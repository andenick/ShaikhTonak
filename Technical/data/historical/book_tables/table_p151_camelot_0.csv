Hp = productive labor;,
GDPr = constant-dollar  GDP  (real gross domestic product); and,
H = all labor (productive and unproductive).,
,Appendix  J contains  detailed  calculations  of  the  Marxian  and  ortho-
"dox  measures  of  productivity,  along  with  associated  measures  of  hours",
,worked. Table 5.10 and Figures 5.19 and 5.20 present the data. Figure 5.19
compares the two  Marxian measures  of  productivity  q and y with the,
"orthodox  measure  y.  Figure  5.20,  which  is  in  index  number  form,  also",
depicts orthodox  measures y2 and y! (BLS). All  measures in Figure  5.19,
"grow steadily throughout  the postwar period, and exhibit a slowdown in",
"their growth  rate over time (Figure  5.19 is a log graph,  so that the  slope",
"of  a  curve  is  the  variable's  rate  of  growth).  Yet,  as  Figure  5.19  shows,",
,the Marxian measure of  productivity  q is between three and four  times
,"as  large  as the  conventional  measure  y.  Moreover,  q  rises  relative  to  y"
,"for significant  periods. This is most notable during the post-1972 period,"
,"which  is  exactly  when  the  pernicious  and  puzzling  ""productivity  slow-"
,"down"" is  supposed  to  have  occurred  (Naples  1987).  Notice  from  Figure"
,5.19 that the growth rate of q slows down gradually over the entire post-
,"war  period,  whereas  y shows  a marked  change  in pattern  in the  critical"
,period  from  1972 to  1982. Figure  5.20  shows that the Marxian  measures
,"(q> y) grow substantially  faster than the orthodox measures (y, y2, yi)."
,The ratio y/q =  (GDP/TP)/(L/L p).19 We have already seen in Figure
,"5.4  that  GNP/TP  falls  from  1972 to  1982,  most  probably  because  the"
,"oil-price shock  in 1973 raises TP relative to GDP. At the same time, the"
,ratio of  total  employment  relative to productive  employment  rises more
,rapidly  in  this  period  (because  of  the  relatively  rapid growth  of  unpro-
,"ductive  employment),  as  shown  in  Figures  5.9  and  5.11.  The  so-called"
productivity,"showdown  exhibited by the conventional measures (y, yt, y2)"
