"an  alternative  to  the  official  accounts  for  market  activities,  we  will  not",
deal  with  nonmarket  and  illegal  activities  in this  particular  work.  Such,
"matters  are,  however,  important  in  any  extension  of  the  basic  accounts",
developed here.,
,The  next  issue  regards the  relations  between profit  and surplus value.
"It is well known that, at the most abstract level of  Marxist theory, aggre-",
gate profit  is simply the monetary expression of  aggregate surplus value.,
But it is often  forgotten  that profit  can also arise from transfers  between,
the circuit of capital and other spheres of social life. Marx calls this latter,
"form of profit profit  on alienation,  which -  unlike profit on surplus value  -",
is  fundamentally  dependent  on  some  sort  of  unequal  exchange.  Its  ex-,
istence  enables  us  to  solve  the  famous  puzzle  of  the  difference  between,
the  sum  of  profits  and  the  sum  of  surplus  values  brought  about  by the,
"transformation  from values to prices of production (Shaikh 1984,1992a).",
"More  importantly,  it  allows  us  to  explain  how  capitalism  can  derive  a",
profit  from  noncapitalist  spheres without  any creation of  surplus value.,
"In what follows,  we will focus on the latter aspect alone, since the former",
has been treated in detail elsewhere (Shaikh 1984).,
,Consider  a barter  between  a noncapitalist  tribe and  a merchant  capi-
"talist. The merchant purchases guns worth £100 in London, barters them",
,"for  furs  from  the tribe,  and sells the furs back in London  for £250. The"
"merchant thus gains £150, which covers both trading costs and merchant",
profit.  Yet  there  has  been  no  corresponding  increase  in  surplus  value.,
"Nor  has  there  been  an  offsetting  loss  to  the members  of  the tribe,  since",
(under this idealized  version of  trade) they have traded one set of  goods,
,(furs)  for  a  more  desirable  set  (guns).  Aggregate  profits  have  risen  by
"£150, apparently out of  thin air. How  is that  possible?",
,The  answer  lies  in  the  fact  that  different  measures  of  gain  have  been
applied  across the two  poles of  the above transaction.  The tribe is oper-,
ating  within  the  simple  commodity  circuit  C-C9,in  which  one  set  C of
use values  is bartered  for  another  useful  set  C.  The comparison  here is,
"in  terms  of  social  usefulness.  At  the  other  pole,  the  merchants  operate",
"within the capital circuit M-C-C'-M',  in which one sum of  money (M =",
"£100) is transformed into a larger sum (M'= £250), through the exchange",
of one set C of use values for a more valuable set C.  Because only one of,
,"the poles is assessed in monetary terms, any monetary gain recorded there"
"has no counterpart at the other pole, so that a net monetary gain appears",
"for  the  system  as  a  whole.  If  both  poles  were  treated  in the  same  way,",
then it would be obvious that one side's monetary gain was another side's,
monetary loss: the tribe would have exchanged assets valued at £250 (furs),
"for those valued at £100 (guns), for a net change of asset value of  -£150;",
the merchants would correspondingly have recorded a net change in asset,
