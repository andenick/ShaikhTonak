value much higher than NIPA-based  sectoral estimates. The discrepancy
"between the two data sources is well known, and still unresolved."
The sectoral effect  and the data-source effect  seem to work in opposite
"directions. Within  a common  data  set,  sectoral  and  aggregate estimates"
"of the rate of surplus value will generally differ,  because the former  fails"
to account  for  value transfers  in and out of the sector: value will always
be transferred  out of the producing sector to the trading sector owing to
"the difference  between producer and purchaser prices, and value may be"
transferred  into  or  out  of  the  producing  sector  due to  producer  price-
value deviations induced by the (tendential) equalization of profit  rates.
"To the extent that the latter effect  tends to be small, the former will dom-"
"inate, and sectoral rates of surplus value will tend to be lower than aggre-"
gate ones. Comparing NIPA-based aggregate and sectoral rates of surplus
"value in Figure 6.5 shows this to be the case, although the trends of the"
two rates are similar. The lower curve in Figure 6.6 makes these notions
"more precise, by showing that the ratio of the NIPA sectoral to the aggre-"
gate rate is roughly 55% and seldom varies by more than ±5%.
"The data-source effect  works in the opposite direction, because census"
measures of value added in manufacturing  are systematically larger than
"NIPA ones, as is evident in Figure 6.5."
The  net  result  of  these  two  effects  is that  census-based  sectoral  esti-
"mates, such as those in Varga and in others who adopt his methodology,"
tend to have a much sharper upward trend than either the sectoral NIPA-
based or aggregate NIPA-IO-based estimates of the rate of surplus value.
Figure 6.5 shows that the average level of the census-based estimate over
the whole postwar period is roughly equal to that of the average aggregate
"rate SVV*, but that the trend of former is much sharper than that of the"
