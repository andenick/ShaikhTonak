wage of  productive  workers are different.  The true measure of  variable,
capital is the nominal wage of productive workers minus any net royalty,
"payments made by them. Thus, in order to estimate true variable capital,",
"we should deduct net interest, net ground rent, and net taxes (net of social",
benefit  expenditures received) paid by production workers from  our ap-,
parent measure of variable capital.,
,"At  a conceptual  level, the calculation  of  net interest  and  net  ground-"
rent payments is relatively straightforward. But the estimation of net taxes,
paid  requires a comparison  between the gross taxes paid by production,
workers and the corresponding transfers  and other social welfare expen-,
"ditures  (for  health,  education,  roads, parks, etc.) directed  back  toward",
them. These further  details are taken up in Section 5.9 and Appendix N.,
Once the sum of  net  royalty  paid  by production  workers NRYwp has,
"been estimated, it must be subtracted from production worker wages and",
added to surplus value in order to obtain the true measures of each. The,
"measure of  surplus value will then be correspondingly larger, as will the",
adjusted  rate  of  surplus  value.  Using  primes  to  denote  these  adjusted,
"measures, we have on the revenue side:",
