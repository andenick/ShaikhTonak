Measuring  the  wealth of  nations,10
"and illegal production (drugs, gambling,  prostitution),  pointing out that",
it would make international comparisons much more meaningful  (Eisner,
"1988, pp. 1613-14). On the other hand, he rejects the notion that ""leisure",
"time"" be  counted  as  a  production  activity,  even  though  most  other  ex-",
tended  accounts  do  add a very large imputation  for  the value of  leisure,
"time to their measures of national output. Finally, he points out (p. 1622)",
that  since  extensions  of  the production  measure to  nonmarket  activities,
require  corresponding  imputations  on  the income  side (as the two  sides,
"must  balance),  extended  accounts  tend  to  give  a radically  different  pic-",
ture of the distribution of income (real and imputed) between capital and,
"labor,  employed  and unemployed,  and so  forth.  For instance,  in  official",
"GNP accounts  for 1966, the share of labor income is 82.6 and of capi-",
tal income 24.3.  In the extended accounts of  Jorgenson and Fraumeni,
"(1987),  because  of  imputations  for  the  ""services"" of  household  durable",
"goods  and  for  the  value  of  household  production  and  leisure  time,  the",
total  (real  and  imputed)  income  of  households  is  raised  over  fivefold!,
,Thus in the Jorgenson-Fraumeni accounts the labor share appears as 93
"and the property share as a mere 7 (Eisner 1988, p. 1672, table S.4).",
,"On the question of  investment,  Eisner argues in favor of  counting the"
net changes in consumer and government durables as part of aggregate in-,
vestment  (as do Ruggles and Ruggles). He notes that various researchers,
also  include  in investment  one or more  of  the  following:  changes  in the,
value of land; expenditures for the development and discovery of natural,
resources; research and development  (R&D)  expenditures; and expendi-,
"tures  on  health,  education,  training,  and  information  (human  capital).",
"As he shows, such adjustments cause enormous changes in the measure of",
"gross investment  and national product.  Finally,  if one accepts the  Haig-",
Simon-Hicks  definition  of  income as that which can be consumed with-,
"out changing real wealth, then real income, savings, and investment must",
all  include  an  adjustment  for  the  net  monetary  revaluations  in  stocks.,
This can add a sharply fluctuating component to the measure of  national,
"product  (Eisner 1988, pp. 1622-5).",
,"From our point of  view, one of  the most intriguing aspects of  Eisner's"
"survey is his discussion of the treatment of police, fire protection, guard,",
and  national  defense  activities.  Recall  that  we classify  all such  activities,
"as  nonproduction  activities.  As  such,  we  would  exclude  them  from  the",
total  product  and  hence  also  from  the  net  product.  Eisner  argues  that,
"they  should  be treated  as intermediate  inputs  rather than final product,",
"citing  Kuznets to  the effect  that  such  activities  constitute  ""the mere cost",
"of  maintaining  the  social  fabric,  a precondition",for  net  product  rather
"than the net product itself"" (cited in Eisner 1988, p. 1617; see also Becker-",
"man 1968, pp. 11-12, 23-4, 27-8). This means that they would be counted",
"as  production  activities  and  would  add  to  the total  product,  but  would",
