"time)  properties  make  it  an  object  of  social  use.  As  such,  these  useful",
objective  material  properties  are quite  distinct  from  the  satisfaction  we,
may or may not derive from its actual use.,
,"Let us consider various such objects. In a factory, a set of workers pro-"
"duces  a  car.  This  car  has  objective  material  properties  -  shape,  color,",
"engine displacement,  etc. -  which make it an object of our consumption.",
These  properties  are the  car's  useful  objective  characteristics  and  serve,
as the  material  basis  for  the  subjective  satisfaction  we may derive  from,
"the car, but they are clearly distinct  from this satisfaction  itself.",
,Now  consider  the case  of  so-called  services.  A  barber uses scissors  to
"transform  the  shape  of  someone's  hair,  thus producing  a material  effect",
"which  is  the  object  of  the  customer's  personal  consumption,  an  effect",
"whose useful  objective properties are evident in the mirror, to the touch,",
"and  even  in  a photograph.  Similarly,  a  singer  who  projects  a song  into",
the air produces an object of  consumption so material that it can be cap-,
"tured on a record and reproduced electronically.  In both cases, the useful",
objective material properties of this song are very different  from the satis-,
"faction one may or may not derive from them (Marx 1963, p. 157).",
,Even transportation  can result in the creation of  a use value.  Broadly
"speaking,  transportation consists of  passenger transport and commodity",
transport.  Each  of  these  encompasses  both  production  and  nonproduc-,
"tion  activities,  depending  on  more  specific  considerations.  For  instance,",
planes or trains taken as part of vacations and visits bring about a desired,
change of location which is a direct element of overall consumption. Thus,
consumption-related  passenger  transport  is  part  of  the  production  ser-,
"vices that enter directly into consumption.  Similarly, by shipping oranges",
"from  their point  of  production to their point  of  consumption,  a trucker",
transforms  a useful  objective property of  these oranges (their location in,
space)  which  is  crucial  to  them  as  objects  of  consumption.  To  be  con-,
,"sumed,  an orange  must  not  merely  be an orange somewhere,  it must  be"
an orange where the consumer is. Transportation  from the orange grove,
"to the consumption region is therefore productive transportation, a com-",
pletion of  the process of  the creation of  an object of  consumption  -  that,
"is, a completion of the process of production.  It is internal to the process",
of  production.4,
