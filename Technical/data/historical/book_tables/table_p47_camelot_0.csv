Basic  theoretical foundations,27
an advertising  firm  from  encompassing  production  activities such as the,
"production  of  a commercial.  Similarly,  since money  is the means of  cir-",
"culation,  all money-dealing  activities also fall into the category of  distri-",
"bution labor.  As  we have already noted,  none of  this implies that distri-",
bution  labor  is in  any way  inferior  (or  superior)  to  production  labor; it,
only implies that the two are distinct.10,
,"Finally,  we  have  all  those  activities  that  revolve  around  the  mainte-"
"nance  and  reproduction  of  the  social  order.  Police,  fire  departments,",
"courts,  and prisons  involve the protection  of  persons,  property,  and the",
social  relations  that  surround  them.  National  defense  and  international,
"affairs do much the same, only on a world scale. General government activ-",
"ities (such as those involving administration,  public assistance, pensions,",
"social security, etc.) fall into the same category. But not all such activities",
are performed in the public sphere. Corporate security personnel and pri-,
"vate guards protect  persons  and their private property.  In each case, use",
"values  enter  as material  inputs  into  activities  designed  to  protect,  main-",
,"tain,  administer,  and  reproduce  the  social  order,  and  as  such  they  are"
quite distinct  from production labor.,
,The  fact  that  most  of  the  activities just  mentioned  are performed  by
the  state  should  not  mislead  us  into  conflating  social  maintenance  and,
reproduction activities with state activities. Corporate security is a private,
"activity. On the other hand, government-owned  electric power plants are",
,"part of production, while government agencies that buy and sell grain are"
engaging  in  distribution  activities.  All  labor  activities  can  have  private,
and public  components.,
,"In the same way,  individual  people  or firms can also encompass  more"
"than one type of activity. A manufacturing firm, for instance, will encom-",
"pass  both  production  and  distribution  (sales,  credit,  advertising)  activi-",
"ties.  Similarly,  a given person  such  as a butcher may both cut meat to a",
customer's  specification  and  also  ring  up  the  purchase.  The  boundary,
,between  production  and  distribution  is in this  case crossed  by the  same
"person.  Nonetheless,  the  boundary  remains  a very real  one.  Should  the",
butcher be so fortunate as to expand into a capitalist enterprise of  sufficient,
"scale, then butchers and cashiers will perform different tasks altogether.11",
,"10  As  noted  in  Chapter  1, one  could  formalize  this  argument  in terms of  Lancas-"
,"ter's  notion  of  commodities  as  characteristics  (Lancaster  1968,  pp.  113-8).  Of"
,"course,  our treatment  would  nonetheless differ  from  a neoclassical  one (see Sec-"
tion 2.3).,
,"11  Because all circuits of capital begin and end with money, every firm must engage"
,in  at  least  some  distribution  activity.  We  are  of  course  unable  to  separate em-
,pirically  the  production  and  distribution  components  of  any  single  person's ac-
,tivities.  But  we  can  (approximately)  separate  out  production  and  nonproduc-
,tion workers within each firm or industry.  This latter division is by far the most
