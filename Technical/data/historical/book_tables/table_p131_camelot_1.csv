"aries taken from NIPA data.  For the service sector, we use the employee",
compensation per full-time equivalent employee (ecserv) as our measure of,
11,"In  NIPA,  the  value  added  of  proprietorships  and  partnerships  is  not  broken"
,"down  into  wages  and  profits.  Ignoring  the  wage  equivalent  of 
self-employed"
,persons  (proprietors and partners) amounts to treating all of  the value added as
,profit-type  income.  We have chosen  instead  to  impute  a wage equivalent  to  the
,"labor  of  self-employed  persons,  and treat  the rest  of  value added  as  profit-type"
,"income  (which  may  be negative  in the case of  losses).  As  Mandel  (1976, p.  945)"
,"notes,  Marx  includes  ""engineers,  technologists  and  even  managers"" under  the"
,"category  of  collective labor. Of  course,  only those involved in capitalist  produc-"
,tion would count as productive workers.
,"12  The  BLS wage data differ  also in reflecting  wage per employed worker,  whereas"
,our  NIPA-based  unit  compensation  ec  is  per  full-time  equivalent  worker.  By
,"using  the  former,  we are  implicitly  assuming  that  the  wage  of  the average pro-"
,duction worker is fairly close to that of  the average full-time production worker.
,"Since the latter is probably  higher than the former,  we somewhat  underestimate"
,variable capital.
