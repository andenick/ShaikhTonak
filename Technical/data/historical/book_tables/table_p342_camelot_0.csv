Surplus value and  profit
The  estimates  of  value  added  and  final  product  in  Appendix  E  and  of
variable  capital  in  Appendix  G  allow  us  to  calculate  surplus  value  and
surplus product.  By definition:
S* = VA* — V* = surplus value (in money form);
S*/ V* = rate of surplus value;
NP* = necessary product (consumption of productive workers)
=  V*;
and
SP* = FP* -  NP* = surplus product.
The  Marxian  measures  may  be  compared  to  naive  estimates  P+  and
P+/EC.
"P + = VA — EC = profit-type income (gross of all business taxes),"
where
VA = FD = NNP = net national product  (NIPA)  and
EC = total wages.
Hence
P +/EC = profit-type income/wage ratio.
"We  may  also  define  more  restricted  measures  of  profit,  such  as  P  ="
P + - I BT  (where  IBT = indirect  business  taxes)  and Pn = P + - I B T- cor-
"porate income tax = profit,  net of  all business taxes."
Table H.I  details surplus value and profit  for the period 1948-89.
