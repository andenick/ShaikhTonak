Measuring  the  wealth of  nations,182
,Aglietta  (1979) places the measurement  of  the rate of  surplus value at
"the heart of  his theory.  According to him, the ""nodal point of  [a] theory",
"of  capitalist  regulation""  is  that  to  ""study  the  articulation  between  the",
laws of capitalist accumulation and the laws of competition means to elu-,
"cidate the contradictory process of the generalization of the wage relation""",
(pp.  17-18). The historical  evolution  of  the rate of  surplus value plays a,
"crucial role in this, because ""the rate of surplus-value is the pivot of capi-",
"talist accumulation"" (p. 87).",
,Although Aglietta does distinguish between productive and unproduc-
"tive labor (1979, p. 89), he does not carry this over to the measurement of",
"the national  product.  Like some others in this section, he uses the NIPA",
measure of value added as a proxy for a corresponding Marxian measure,
(p.  88). But Aglietta does not attempt to measure the money rate of sur-,
"plus  value  directly,  because  he  believes  that  the  impact  of  price-value",
deviations is significant enough to make the money rate a biased indicator,
"of the trend of the value rate of surplus value. For this reason, he sets out",
"""to find a more faithful  statistical indicator [of the] long run trend"" in the",
value  rate  of  surplus  value  (p.  88).  He  concludes  that  the  share  of  real,
"wages in productivity  (the ""real social  wage cost"") is a more appropriate",
measure  of  the  share  of  the value  of  labor power  in the value  added by,
"living  labor,  assuming  that  social  productivities  (the  reciprocals  of  the",
unit  labor  values)  of  the  consumer  and  producer  sectors  rise at  roughly,
the same rate in the long run. Our derivation of this relation is in Appen-,
"dix L. As noted previously,  Aglietta's argument is reminiscent of  an ear-",
"lier one by Perlo (1974), who also claims that the trend of  the rate of ex-",
"ploitation can be more accurately estimated  from the ""index of  workers'",
"share,"" which  he  defines  to  be  the  ratio  of  the  real  take-home  pay  of",
"workers to their productivity  (Perlo  1974, p. 30).",
,We  have  already  seen  that  price-value  deviations  have  only  a  minor
"effect  on  aggregates  such  as  the  rate  of  surplus  value,  since  the  money",
,and value rates are quite close and have virtually identical trends (see Sec-
tion 5.10). Thus Aglietta is wrong in making this particular issue a central,
concern.42 Although this does not invalidate his procedure for estimating,
"the long-term trend of the rate of  surplus value, it does prevent him from",
attempting  to measure its level.,
,The  theoretical  content  of  Aglietta's  technique  can  be  addressed  by
,comparing  his real social  wage cost  (real wage share) w' to the ratio it is
presumed  to  approximate  -  the  share v'  of  the  value  of  labor  power  in,
"labor value added. By definition, v'= V/( V + S) =  1/(1 + e), where e =  S/V.",
,"42  Aglietta  could  have measured the money  rate of  surplus value directly,  in order"
