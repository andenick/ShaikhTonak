"social  accounting  of  taxes  and  transfers.  However,  it  should  be  noted"
"that,  where  such  calculations  have  been  made,  they  greatly  strengthen"
our conclusion that the net balance is strongly against the working popu-
"lation; that is, U.S. workers pay a net tax to the state, rather than receiv-"
"ing a net subsidy from it in the form of some ""social wage"" (Miller 1989)."
Appendix N lists the detailed calculations of  our social accounting of
taxes and  benefits.  Figure 5.22 shows the resulting tax and benefit  rates
"(relative to total employee compensation), and Figure 5.23 shows the cor-"
responding  net transfer  rate for  the United  States  from  1952 to  1985. It
"is immediately  evident  that,  for  most  of  the postwar  period,  wage and"
salary earners paid more in taxes than they received in social benefit ex-
"penditures. As a result, the true rate of surplus value is generally higher"
than the apparent one (see Figure 5.24).

The previously calculated Marxian measures are the money forms
of  Marxian  categories  -  the monetary expressions of  realized  quantities
of  value. It is therefore  of  interest to see if these money measures accu-
rately represent  the levels and  movements of the underlying labor value
