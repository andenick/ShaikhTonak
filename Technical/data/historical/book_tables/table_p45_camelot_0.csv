,"production,  then new production labor must be performed  to  transform",
,"it into a new use value  (such as orange juice).  On the other hand,  if it is",
,consumed  then  consumption  activity  (though  not  labor)  is  required.  In,
,"either case,  the original  labor remains what it was,  since its status is not",
,"determined  by the use to  which the  fruits  of  this  labor,  so to  speak,  are",
put.6,,
,A second important point can be made even at this level. All economic,
"theory  distinguishes  between  production  and  consumption,  and  recog-",,
,nizes that only production results in the creation of new use values or (as,
,classical economists put it) in the creation of new wealth of nations. Even,
,neoclassical  economics distinguishes between the production that creates,
,objects  of  utility  (the  arguments  of  utility  functions)  and  the  personal,
,consumption  that  realizes the potential  utility  of  these  objects.  Thus all,
,economic  theory contains  an elementary  distinction between  production,
,and  nonproduction  activities.  What  distinguishes  the  classical/Marxian,
,tradition  from  the  neoclassical/Keynesian  one  is  the location  of  the di-,
,viding line. The former places distribution and social maintenance activ-,
,"ities  in the  sphere  of  nonproduction  activities,  whereas the latter  places",
them in production.7,,
,The  dividing  line  between  production  and  personal  consumption  ac-,
,tivities  is  at  the  same  time  a  dividing  line  between  labor  and  nonlabor,
,activities. But it was precisely this latter division which the classical econ-,
,"omists  felt  to  be inadequate,  because it was their contention that not all",
,labor  resulted  in the  creation  of  new  wealth.  It was therefore  necessary,
,for  them  to  distinguish  not  merely between  production  and  nonproduc-,
,"tion  activity,  but also between production  and nonproduction labor -  in",
,"other words, between what they called ""productive"" and ""unproductive""",
labor.,,
,It must be emphasized once again that the classical distinction between,
,production and nonproduction labor is essentially analytical. It is founded,
,on the insight  that certain types of  labor share a common property with,
,"the activity of  consumption  -  namely, that in their performance they use",
,up a portion  of  existing  wealth  without  directly resulting in the creation,
,of  new  wealth.  To  say  that  these  labors  indirectly  result  in the  creation,
,of this wealth is only another way of  saying that they are necessary. Con-,
,"sumption  also  indirectly  results  in  production,  as  production  indirectly",
,results in consumption.  But this hardly obviates the need for distinguish-,
ing between the two.,,
