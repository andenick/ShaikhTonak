"to very different  values of  labor power, and hence rates of  surplus value,",
depending  on  the  proportion  in which  the  products  of  the two  types  of,
unproductive labors enter the standard of living. The rate of surplus value,
depends only on the length of the working day and the unit value of labor,
"power in either case, other things being equal. But this unit value of labor",
power is not independent of the conditions under which noncapitalist (i.e.,
unproductive) production labors are performed. These considerations are,
especially important  in the context of  the Third World.,
,"In a similar way, even though both salespeople and (say) military peo-"
"ple  are  primarily  nonproduction  personnel,  they  do  not  have  the  same",
impact  on  reproduction.  Suppose  that  the  amount  of  value  and  surplus,
"value is given, that new sales employment is financed out of current profits,",
and that  new  military expenditures  are financed  directly out  of  taxes  on,
wages. An increase in sales employment diminishes the amount of surplus,
value left  for  aggregate  profit  (though  it may well transfer  more surplus,
value to the firms that increase their sales force). Aggregate profits there-,
"fore  decline,  other  things  being  equal.  On the  other  hand,  an  increased",
military employment financed out of taxes on wages need not alter aggre-,
"gate  profit.16  In  both  cases,  the  mass  and  rate  of  surplus  value  are un-",
"altered, but aggregate profit is altered in one case and not the other -  even",
though  both  types  of  labor  involved  are  unproductive  labor  from  the,
standpoint  of  capital.,
,It  is  important  to  note  that  all  capitalistically  employed  labor  is  ex-
"ploited  by capital,  whether  it is productive  labor or unproductive  labor.",
The rate of  exploitation  of  each is their respective ratio of  surplus labor,
time to necessary labor time.  Necessary labor time is simply the value of,
"the  labor  power  involved,  that  is, the labor value of  the average  annual",
consumption  per worker in the activities in question.  Surplus labor time,
is excess  of  working  time  over  necessary  labor  time.  In the case  of  pro-,
"ductive workers, their rate of exploitation is also the rate of surplus value,",
since their surplus labor time results in surplus value. This concept is so,
practical that we can use it to calculate the separate rates of  exploitation,
of  productive and unproductive workers (see Sections 4.2 and 5.6).,
,The illustrations in this section were designed to emphasize the point that
,"the distinction between productive and unproductive labor is necessary, but"
"not sufficient,  for the analysis of reproduction. We need also to know the",
specific  components of  unproductive labor and their interaction with the,
circuits of capital and revenue. This is precisely why we began our analy-,
"sis  with  the  general  distinction  between  production,  distribution,  social",
