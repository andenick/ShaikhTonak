must  be  subtracted  from  variable  capital  and  added  to  surplus  value.,
"Shaikh  makes  detailed  estimates  of  this  effect  for  1952,  1961, and  1970.",
Taxes  actually  paid  by  workers  are  assumed  to  consist  of  all  of  social,
security taxes as well as the estimated labor portion of  income taxes and,
"of  the  small  category  called  ""other taxes  and nontaxes"" (personal  prop-",
"erty  taxes,  license  and  other  fees,  etc.).  The  corresponding  benefits  of",
workers  are estimated  as the  sum of  government  expenditures  on  social,
"security,  unemployment  benefits,  and  housing  and  community  develop-",
"ment,  as  well  as  the  workers'  share  of  health,  education,  utilities,  and",
transportation  expenditures.  The  net  tax  is  calculated  as  the  difference,
between labor taxes and labor benefits.  Shaikh finds that this quantity is,
positive in all three years sampled.  Applying the resulting net tax rate to,
the wages of productive workers raises his estimated rate of surplus value,
"by 7<7o-16<7o (Shaikh 1978b, pp. 35-8).",
,Tonak  (1984)  extends  this  approach  to  the whole  postwar  period.  Be-
cause  previously  published  estimates  of  the labor  proportion  of  income,
"tax payments  were available  only  for  selected  years,  he develops  a good",
annual  proxy  for  this  proportion  by taking  the  share  of  wages  and  sal-,
,"aries in personal income.49 This ""labor share"" is then used to estimate not"
"only the amounts of  income taxes and fees paid by workers, but also the",
amounts of certain social benefit expenditures (such as health and educa-,
"tion)  that  are deemed  to  be  spent  on  workers.50  On the tax  side,  Tonak",
corrects  for  the  fact  that  a  portion  of  property  taxes  paid  by  workers,
shows up under indirect business taxes because NIPA treats homeowners,
as rental firms renting out their own homes to themselves (a fact we have,
"already  encountered  in Section  3.1.3),  and re-assigns the lottery  receipts",
of  the government to the category of  workers' taxes (as a kind of  volun-,
,"tary net transfer).  On the government  expenditure  side,  he estimates the"
"labor  portion  of  social  benefits,  both  with  and  without  expenditures  on",
"public  assistance.51  These  factors,  plus  revisions  in  the  NIPA  accounts",
"themselves,  account  for the differences  between Shaikh's and Tonak's es-",
timates of the net tax on labor; but the basic patterns are the same. Tonak,
,"too finds that the net tax is generally positive (except in 1975), so that his"
