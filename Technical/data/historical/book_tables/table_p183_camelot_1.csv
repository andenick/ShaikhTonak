two alternate positions on the net tax (social wage) paid by workers: if one
believes that  workers' taxes return to them in the  form  of  social  welfare
16  Mandel provides estimates of the realized rate of  surplus value in manufacturing
"gross and net of  depreciation,  and with and without  50 of  salaries. This gives"
him four alternate measures: gross and net measures with variable capital defined
as  production  worker  wages; and  gross  and  net  measures  with  50 of  salaries
included in variable capital. The first two grow by roughly 50 over the postwar
"period,  while the latter two grow  more slowly  (25 for  the gross rate and 35"
"for  the  net  rate).  Mandel  feels  that  these  latter  measures  ""probably  correspond"
"more closely to the actual development"" (1975, pp.  174-5)."
"17  Perlo (1974, pp. 26-7)  notes that one should estimate surplus value net of  depre-"
"ciation,  but his empirical estimates are confined  to gross surplus value."
18  The  numerator  of  both  measures  is (pre-  or post-tax)  hourly  wages deflated  by
"the  consumer  price  index,  and  the  denominator  of  both  is  hourly  productivity"
"(Perlo  1974, p. 30; Aglietta  1979, pp. 88-91)."
