"within  classical  and  Marxian  frameworks,  the consideration  of  nonpro-"
"duction labor changes the very nature of the accounts, the picture that we"
"see,  and the conclusions  that we draw."
"In  our  presentation,  we  have  concentrated  on  production  accounts,"
since  that  is  where  our  essential  difference  with  conventional  accounts
arises.  Extending  our  accounts  to  encompass  other  circuits  would  only
"further  develop  this  difference,  since  all  such  extensions  must  build  on"
the  core  provided  by  the  production  accounts.  We  share  with  most  ex-
tended accounts the goals of including household and Other noncapitalist
production  activities;  of  keeping  track  of financial flows; of  linking ob-
served flows and the corresponding  stocks; and of  accounting  for the de-
"pletion  of  resources.  But at the same time,  the core differences  continue"
"to  show  up  even  at  this  level.  For  instance,  unlike  orthodox  extended"
"accounts, we would not treat household and government durables as cap-"
"ital  goods  merely  because  they  are durable,  and we would  not  impute a"
fictitious flow of  gross  profits.  Much less would  we apply the  same pro-
"cedure to accumulated  ""human capital"" (see Section  1.3)."
"Finally,  it is important  to  note that  we have emphasized  the effects  of"
unproductive activities on profitability and growth because we believe that
these interactions are essential to an understanding of the actual workings
