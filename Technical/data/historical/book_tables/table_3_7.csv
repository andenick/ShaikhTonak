nan,Figure  3.8.  IO accounts and Marxian categories: Private royalties
payments.,nan
nan,Figure  3.8 depicts  the overall  effects  of  royalty  flows  on the mapping
between Marxian and IO categories. Some royalty payments (RYp + RYt),nan
made  by the primary  sectors  (production  and trade)  are listed  as costs,nan
and  hence  recorded  in the intermediate  inputs  of  these  sectors.  Others,nan
(RYp + RY/)  are shown  as disbursement  from  the value  added  in these,nan
"sectors.  Finally,  transfers  out of  household  income  and other  final ex-",nan
"penditures are listed as purchases (RYC, RY^ in the final demand column.",nan
nan,Table 3.7 provides the corresponding  algebraic summary.  Note that in
"light  of  the discussion  concerning  the effects  of  transfers  of  value,  no",nan
"general pattern between VA* and VA, or between S* and P, has been pre-",nan
sumed  to  hold.  But the rate  of  surplus  value  SVV*  is shown  as being,nan
larger than the measure of the profit/wage  ratio because this general em-,nan
pirical pattern is rooted in the fact that V* < W.,nan
3.2.2  Profit-type,income  can exceed surplus  value
nan,We have seen that whereas royalty payments by primary sectors
nan,to  secondary  sectors  tend  to  reduce  the measure  of  profit-type  income
nan,"relative to surplus value,  similar transfers  originating in household, gov-"
nan,"ernment,  or foreign  sectors  (i.e.,  in nonbusiness  sectors)  tend  to make"
"profit-type  income larger relative to surplus value. At an empirical level,",nan
nan,the profit-reducing effect of transfers of value swamps the profit-increasing
nan,effect.  But the very fact  that two such opposing  effects  exist implies that
nan,we cannot  say a priori  whether or not surplus value will be greater than
nan,total profit. This only serves to emphasize the theoretical point that aggre-
gate  profit  is the sum of  realized  surplus  value  and the net transfer  of,nan
nan,value between circuits of capital and circuits of revenue (see Section 2.4).
