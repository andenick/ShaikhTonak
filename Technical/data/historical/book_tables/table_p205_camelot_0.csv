"construction, and services, presumably on the grounds that they represent",
noncapitalist  flows.  This seems improbable to  us. Until the invention  of,
"the legal  form  called a ""corporation,"" all capitalist enterprises were non-",
corporate;  hence  the  noncorporate  form  of  these  particular  enterprises,
does  not  render  them  noncapitalist.  Nor  is there  any compelling  reason,
"to  believe that  most  of  noncorporate  agriculture,  construction,  and ser-",
"vices is nonprofit.  In any case, this last set of  deductions  further  reduces",
Moseley's estimates of  net value added by about 6% in 1958.,
,From the point of view of our present procedure (summarized in Table
"6.4),  Moseley's  procedure leaves out the portion of  royalties  RYpt which",
represents ground rent and financial services charges paid by the produc-,
"tion and trade sectors,46 as well as the intermediate inputs M'n of the trad-",
"ing  sectors.  On  the  other  hand,  it  adds  in  the  GDP  of  the  nonimputed",
"royalties sectors (finance, ground rent, and royalties), which partially  off-",
sets the first two exclusions. The net effect  is that his estimate of  Marxian,
gross value added is some 20% lower than ours in 1958. This is the prin-,
cipal reason for  his lower rate of  surplus value.,
,Tonak  (1984) focuses  on the impact of  state taxation and expenditures
"on the rate of  surplus value. As part of  his empirical analysis, he extends",
Shaikh's estimates of the net tax to the whole postwar period in the Unit-,
ed States.  He  also  attempts to  provide  a fairly  simple approximation  of,
"Marxian value added, from which he subtracts his estimated variable cap-",
ital to obtain a measure of surplus value. The purpose of this approxima-,
tion is to trace the impact of the net tax on the U.S.  rate of  surplus value,
in the postwar period.,
,Tonak  approximates  Marxian  gross  value  added  by  using  the  NIPA
measure of  nonimputed  business GDP.47  This is similar to the approach,
"of  Moseley,  except  that  Tonak  does  not  make any  further  subtractions.",
Thus in 1958 his measure of value added is about 6% higher than that of,
,"Moseley's,  though  still  12% lower than ours  (for  the same reasons  as in"
"Moseley).  As  it  turns  out,  his  estimate  of  variable  capital  is  also  lower",
,"than ours by roughly the same percentage (14%), primarily because (like"
"Mage,  Shaikh,  and Moseley)  he neglects  to  take  account  of  the produc-",
tive  portion  of  the  wage  equivalent.48  These  two  underestimates  end up,
