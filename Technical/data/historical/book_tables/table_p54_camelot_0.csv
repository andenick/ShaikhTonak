of  new wealth.  Even  orthodox  economics then  admits that  some mon-,
"etary  transactions  correspond  to  transfer  payments,  which  ""are simply",
"means of redistributing, among the members of the community, the goods",
"and  services  produced  in  the  economy""  (Beckerman  1968, p.  7). As a",
"practical  measure, the theoretical  notion  of  marketability  must then be",
applied  in such a way as to exclude transactions involving transfer  pay-,
"ments from  those involving production, on the grounds that the persons",
"receiving the former  do not ""render current services"" (BEA 1986, p. xi).",
"Yet at the same time, those who administer such payments are counted",
"as producing  wealth.  Thus,  in orthodox  economics, the flow of  unem-",
ployment  benefits  is excluded  from  the measure of  production  because,
it  does not  correspond  to  any service rendered  by those who receive it.,
Unemployment  benefits  are  a transfer  of  wealth.  But  the civil  servants,
who administer these large and growing transfers  of wealth are counted,
as producing new wealth in the form of administrative services. In Marx-,
"ian economics, both would be excluded from  production.",
"2.4  Production labor, surplus value, and  profit",
,Any concrete capitalist social formation is a mixture of capitalist
and noncapitalist relations of production in which the former dominates.,
But the dominance of capital should not obscure the fact that all spheres,
"participate in the reproduction of the social formation, and that the capi-",
talist  sphere is not  independent  of  the others. This gives rise to several,
new considerations.,
The first issue concerns the difference between capitalistically produced,
wealth and total new wealth. We have already noted that all types of pro-,
"duction  labor create new wealth. Thus, household  and commodity pro-",
duction labor create use values that are bearers of value aimed at earning,
a  revenue;  they  create  simple  commodities.  Capitalist  commodity  pro-,
duction labor  creates use values that  also are bearers of both value and,
"surplus value, and are aimed at making a profit;  such labor creates com-",
"modity capital  (Marx  1963, pp. 156-7). The wealth of capitalist  nations",
"generally encompasses all three forms, in proportions that vary over time,",
"space,  and  stage of  capitalist  development.  But  not  all are captured  in",
conventional accounts. Commodity production and capitalist commodity,
production are generally well covered (subject to the usual difficulties  of,
"estimating  hidden  transactions)  because the product  is sold  for  money,",
and much of the nonmarketed  product  (such as directly consumed  farm,
"production,  repairs  to  owner-occupied  houses, etc.)  is captured  by im-",
puting a money value to it.  But official  national accounts still leave out,
"the  imputed  value  of  household  production,  although  all extended  ac-",
counts now correct for this (see Chapter  1). Because our concern is with,
