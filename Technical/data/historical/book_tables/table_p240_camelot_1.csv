measure of productivity q* (defined  as real total product per productive
labor hour) is about 3 times as large as the conventional measure (defined
"as real GDP per labor hour) (Section 5.12, Table 5.14)."
Trends over the postwar  period  also differ.  Marxian total product de-
"creases slightly relative to IO gross product, and also declines slightly rel-"
"ative to GNP (except for 1973-77, when the oil-price rise, which shows up"
"in the cost of intermediate inputs, temporarily reverses the trend). Marx-"
"ian gross final product also declines moderately relative to GNP, as does"
Marxian net final product relative to NNP (Figure 5.4).
"Interestingly,  productive employment  Lp is stagnant  for  the first half"
"of  the  postwar  period,  and  then  begins a steady but  modest  rise in the"
"mid-1960s.  But  unproductive  employment  rises  sharply  throughout,  so"
that the ratio of productive labor to total employment falls by more than
37%  while  that  of  unproductive  labor  to  productive  labor  rises  by al-
"most  138% (Table 5.5 and Figures 5.7, 5.9, and 5.11). A similar  pattern"
holds for  total  wages: the productive worker wage bill Wp (which is the
same as variable capital V*) falls relative to total wages W as the unpro-
ductive  wage bill  Wu  rises  sharply  relative  to  that  of  productive  labor.
"This  tells  us that  it  is the  movement  in the  relative  employment  levels,"
"not in the relative wage rates, which is crucial. Indeed, the wage rate of"
