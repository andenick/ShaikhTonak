the share of  household  consumption  represents  between  75% and 80%,
of the total output of the industry. For other destinations of the product,
"it was not possible to find direct information,  so the following estimation",
method has been used. Starting with the demand structure for eating and,
"drinking  places in the  1972 study,  an iterative method  was employed  to",
ensure  that  the  amount  of  input  shown  in  each  industry  is compatible,
with  the  tentative  level  of  demand  for  the  eating  and  drinking  places',
product.,
,"The input  structure is determined  in two steps. As mentioned,  eating"
"and drinking places are treated  in earlier studies as a ""margin"" industry",
integrated  with trade.  It  follows  that  basic inputs  are shown directly at,
their  destination  and  that  the margin  is shown  on the row of  the trade,
"industry.  For  each  study,  the  amount  of  basic  inputs  used  for  private",
consumption  expenditure is shown in a separate table that  describes the,
bridge between the input-output classification and the detailed categories,
"of the final demand (Simon 1965; BE A 1970, 1974).",
,"In particular, these tables display the contribution of each industry for"
,the category of meals and beverages. If we are ready to assume that the
method  of  production  for  private consumption  is the same as for  other,
"destinations, we can then determine the amount of inputs used by eating",
"and drinking places. In these tables, the quantity corresponding with trade",
represents  the  margin  added  in  the  preparation  of  the  meal.  If  eating,
"and  drinking places are represented  separately,  this margin must be de-",
composed  between  material  inputs  and  value added.  This is the second,
"step  of  the  transformation.  Without  additional  information,  one must",
assume that  this input  structure is identical to that  for  trade. This leads,
to an unavoidable distortion: oil products are a relatively large input of,
"the trade industry because of the transport  also carried by this industry,",
while this is hardly a characteristic of eating and drinking places.,
