"of  productive  workers.  Even so, Okishio and Nakatani's estimate of  e =",
,(1 -  n)/n  =  134.4% in 1980 is substantially lower than Izumi's (1980) esti-
"mate of  e = 205% in 1975, which itself  is lower than it should be because",
"Izumi overestimates the value of labor power, as we will describe shortly.",
"Okishio  and  Nakatani  (1985,  p.  8)  once  again  note  that  their  result  is",
"""lower than the expected level,"" and once again explain this as due to the",
fact that realized rates of surplus value for manufacturing embody a sub-,
stantial transfer of value from other sectors. But such a  transfer-of-value,
effect  would not explain the discrepancy between their result and that of,
"Izumi,  particularly  since  his  measure  is  for  ""materials  goods  producing",
"sectors,"" in which manufacturing  undoubtedly  plays a great part. This is",
an issue that clearly needs further  investigation.,
,"Izumi defines productive industries as nonagricultural ""materials goods"
"producing  sectors"" only.  Trade,  finance  and insurance,  real estate,  com-",
"munications,  and  the  whole  service  sector  are relegated  to  the  category",
"of  ""services,"" all of  which are considered  unproductive  (Izumi  1980, pp.",
4-6). Unit labor-value/producer-price ratios are calculated in the manner,
"shown  in  Section  3.6,  and  these  are applied  to  the  producer-price  com-",
ponent of productive worker consumption to derive what we would define,
as  the  value  of  productive  labor  power  V  (pp.  9-10).  But  at  this  point,
"Izumi (p. 10) stops to ask: ""By arguing that the labor of  only production",
"workers  in  the  material  goods  producing  sectors  creates  value,  how  do",
"we account for the consumption of services by production workers?"" His",
"response is to  assume that  ""when production  workers consume  services,",
"they  are,  in effect,  consuming  indirectly the material  goods  required  for",
"the  supply  of  these  services"" (pp.  10-11).  So  he adds  an estimate  of  the",
labor value of  the total  (direct and indirect) materials requirements Cm'u,
"of  the  unproductive  (service)  sectors56  to  the  value  of  labor  power  V,",
yielding an expanded value of labor power V  = V + Cm'u. This is then sub-,
tracted  from  the total  hours  of  productive  labor  Hp  to obtain  (reduced),
"surplus  value  S / = H p - V / = ( H p - V ) - C mu  = S-Cmu,  where  S = our",
definition of surplus value. Note the similarity between the Okishio (1959),
and Izumi (1980) treatments of the unproductive expenditures of produc-,
tive workers: the former adds to productive worker consumption the direct,
and indirect workers' consumption induced by the unproductive expendi-,
"tures of  production workers, while the latter adds the direct and indirect",
"materials used up in these same unproductive  activities.  Quite naturally,",
Izumi also derives estimates of the labor value rate of surplus value which,
"are ""consistently  lower"" than the money  rate of  surplus value  estimated",
