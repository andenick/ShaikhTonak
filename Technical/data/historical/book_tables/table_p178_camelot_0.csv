"lower this ratio in the workers' consumption goods sector, the lower will"
be his profit/wage  ratio P/W  relative to his value rate S/V.  Wolff  notes
that his empirical estimates of this ratio are mostly less than I.9 And here
it  seems very likely that  Wolff's  procedure  leads to  biased  estimates of
this value/price  ratio.  Estimates  of  labor  values require data  on  input-
"output flows and also on labor flows. Ideally, these labor flows should be"
adjusted  for skill differences;  only if the differences  among sectoral wage
rates are due largely to skill differences  may one then plausibly substitute
relative  wage  coefficients  for  labor  coefficients.  Wolff  uses  wage  coeffi-
cients  because  he  is unable  to  obtain  data  on  labor  coefficients  (Wolff
"1977a, p. 148, n. 9). But for Puerto Rico, the substitution of wage coeffi-"
cients for  skill-adjusted  labor coefficients  is highly suspect. It is probable
that in Puerto Rico (as in most Third World countries) poor people spend
"most of their income on agricultural products and other staples, and that"
the workers in the sectors that supply these goods are relatively underpaid
(relative to their skill level). Agricultural workers in Puerto Rico are par-
"ticularly underpaid, averaging between 40 and 60 of the wage of other"
"laborers (Reynolds and Gregory 1965, p. 65, table 2-8). This means that,"
"in  a country  like  Puerto  Rico,  the  substitution  of  wage coefficients  for"
"skill  coefficients 
is  likely  to  seriously  underestimate  the  labor  value of"
"workers' consumption  goods, thus giving rise to a large discrepancy be-"
tween  the  profit/wage  ratio  and  the  estimated  rate  of  surplus  value. A
20-30 differential  between skill-adjusted  wage rates in the two types
"of  sectors would  easily account  for  Wolff's  results. Furthermore,  to the"
extent that wages in the consumption-goods sector catch up to the average
"wage, the gap between the estimated rate of surplus value and the  profit/"
