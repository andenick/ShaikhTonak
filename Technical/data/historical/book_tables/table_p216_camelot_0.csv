Critical  analysis of previous  empirical  studies,197
"is another matter altogether,  since they represent transfers as opposed to",
"purchases. To be consistent  with his own sectoral division,  Izumi should",
have used only the producer-price components of the consumption vector.,
,Izumi's  cross-country  comparisons  are  harder  to  evaluate.  His  treat-
"ment of the value of  labor power lowers all of these estimates, but we do",
not  know to  what  degree this effect  operates  in Japan and South Korea.,
"He  claims  that  the  rate of  surplus  value  is  highest  in the  United  States,",
"despite its highest wages and shortest working day, because U.S.  average",
"productivity  is  so  much  greater.  The  opposite  holds  for  South  Korea,",
"with Japan in the middle (Izumi 1983, p.  14). It is interesting to note that",
"Kalmans (1992, pp. 124-30) also finds that both the money and value rates",
,of  surplus  value  are  higher  in  the  United  States  than  in  Japan.  On  the
"whole,  Izumi's study leads him to three conclusions: the rate of  exploita-",
,tion rises over time; it is higher in more advanced capitalist countries; and
it grows more rapidly at lower levels of  development  (p. 19).,
,Wolff (1977b) provides the first published attempt to construct a general
procedure  for  estimating  Marxian  categories  from  input-output  tables.,
"He  begins  with  the  assumption  that  all  labor  is  productive,  shows  how",
"unit labor-value/producer-price  ratios may then be calculated,  and dem-",
onstrates  that  money  and  labor  value  calculations  are  completely  sym-,
metric  when  all  labor  is  assumed  to  be  productive  (pp.  88-9).  He  then,
"introduces  the  distinction  between  productive  and  unproductive  labor,",
being  careful  to  note that  unproductive  activities  can be quite  necessary,
(p.  97). This leads him to divide the IO tables into productive and unpro-,
