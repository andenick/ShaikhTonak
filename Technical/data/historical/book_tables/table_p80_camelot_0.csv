"prisons,  defense  and  international  affairs,  and  general  administration.",
All of these are nonproduction activities.,
,"Within conventional national accounts, government receipts consist of"
"taxes  (business  and  personal,  net  of  subsidies  and  transfers),  fees  and",
"fines,  rents  and  royalties,  and  personal  and  employer  contributions  for",
social insurance. Government disbursements consist of the purchases of,
goods and services (including payments to unproductive sectors and gov-,
"ernment  employees), transfer  payments  to  persons,  net  interest  paid  to",
"persons  and  foreigners,15  and  net  subsidies  to  government  enterprises,",
minus dividends received by government. The government surplus or  def-,
"icit is the difference  between receipts and disbursements (BEA 1986, pp.",
ix-xii).,
,Input-output  accounts only partially capture the flows associated with
"general government. On the revenue side, they only pick up business pay-",
"ments (taxes, fees, net interest paid) to government. Household payments",
"to government, like those to the royalties sector, do not explicitly show up",
,"here. On the use side, transfer  payments to persons and business are ex-"
cluded (having been netted out of taxes and fees received by government).,
,This leaves only two major  elements: government purchases of goods
,and services G' (which include royalty payments such as ground rent and
"finance  charges);  and  purchases  of  labor  power,  the wages WG paid  to",
government employees. Total government expenditures G = G' + WG. In-,
,put-output  accounts treat these two components in quite different  ways.
,Government purchases G' are treated as part of the final use of the prod-
,"uct, and therefore appear under final demand. In keeping with the ortho-"
,"dox treatment  of royalties, expenditures on net interest and ground rent"
are treated as purchases of the output of the royalties sector.,
,"Treating  G'  as part  of  final  use, rather  than  as an intermediate  input"
,"into some government  production  activity, is an implicit admission that"
,general government activities are nonproduction activities. To be consis-
"tent,  one would also have to similarly treat the government purchase of",
,labor power WG as part of the same nonproduction  activity -  but this is
,"not  done.  On  the  contrary,  IO-NIPA  accounts  treat  government  pur-"
,chases  of  labor  power  as  purchases  of  a  service which  is the  sole con-
,stituent  of  a  government  net  product  (and  hence  of  government  value
,"added).  Since  these  wages  do  not  appear  anywhere  in  the  accounts,  a"
,"dummy ""government industry"" is added to the IO table: its row contains"
