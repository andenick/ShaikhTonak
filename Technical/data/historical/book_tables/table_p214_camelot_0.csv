by others at the time (p. 13). He too explains this as arising from transfers
"of  value  from  agriculture  to  industry  in Japan,  which make the realized"
(money) rate of  surplus value in industry much larger than the value rate
"(1980, p. 13; 1983, p. 13). Izumi (1983) extends his estimates to later years"
"in Japan, as well as to the United States and the Republic of Korea. These"
later estimates for Japan are somewhat higher and rise rapidly. Table 6.8
"compares the estimates of Okishio (1959), Izumi (1980,1983), and Okishio"
and Nakatani  (1985).
"Izumi's discussion is sophisticated and insightful,  although we disagree"
with his treatment of the value of labor power (to which we return shortly).
"He  provides  estimates  of  industry  rates of  surplus value,  and notes that"
they differ greatly from corresponding profit/wage ratios because the latter
reflect transfers of value between industries and between industry and agri-
culture.  This indicates that  profit/wage  ratios are not reliable  indicators
"of  industry rates of  exploitation,  which invalidates many past studies on"
"the subject (Izumi 1980, pp. 15-21). He also finds that big businesses have"
"higher value rates of surplus value, again in contradiction to studies based"
on money measures (p. 26).
"In a subsequent  paper,  Izumi extends this same method to a compari-"
"son  between  the  rates  of  surplus  value  in  Japan,  the United  States,  and"
"South  Korea (Izumi  1983, p.  10). Here his results are even more at odds"
"with those of  other studies, including Amsden's study analyzed earlier in"
"this section, in that he finds value rates to be lowest for South Korea and"
highest  for  the United  States.  This implies that the rate of  surplus value
"rises with the level of  development  -  not only historically, but also cross-"
sectionally.  He explains this by arguing that because previous studies are
"of money rates of  surplus value, they capture not only surplus value pro-"
duced  within the nonagricultural  productive  sector but also value trans-
"ferred to that sector. This transfer of surplus value is very large for Japan,"
