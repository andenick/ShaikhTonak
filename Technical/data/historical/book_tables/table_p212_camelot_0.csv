"A*-(conwp)p = 0.518,  of  unit  surplus  value  ( l - f l ')  = 0.482,  and  of  the"
"rate of surplus value e'=  (1 -n')/n'= 
92.9%. He notes that his estimated"
"labor value rate of surplus value ""may be considered to be lower than the"
"level  which  is  expected"" (1959,  p.  8),  given  the  results  of  previous  esti-"
mates of  the money rate of  surplus value.  But he argues that the money
rates are higher than the value rates because the former reflect large trans-
fers  of  value  from  the agricultural  sector  (pp.  8-9).  While this may well
"be  true,  his  estimate  of  the  value  rate  is  itself  biased  downward  by  his"
treatment  of  unproductive  expenditures.  Correcting  for this by  dividing
"ri  by  1.086  raises the  estimated  rate of  surplus  value  by  about  20%, as"
shown in Table 6.8  (to  follow).
The corrected estimate of e =  112.8% for 1951  is theoretically and empir-
ically consistent with the subsequent Okishio and Nakatani (1985) estimate
of  e =  134.4% in  1980.  This  latter  study  also  distinguishes  between pro-
"ductive and unproductive labor, but counts services as fully productive  -"
probably because the 1980 input-output  table does not merge the service
sector  with  the  banking  and  real  estate  sectors.  Productive  sectors  are
"defined  as  all  business  sectors  except  trade  and  finance,  insurance,  and"
"real  estate.  Our  procedure  is  quite  close  to  this,55  except  that  we  count"
"business,  legal,  household,  and  miscellaneous  professional  services  as"
part  of  the  royalties  sector.  The  calculation  procedure  for  unit-value/
