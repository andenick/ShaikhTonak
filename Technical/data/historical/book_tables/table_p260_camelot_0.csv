intersection  of  the  noncomparable-imports  row  and the  net-export  col-
umn (before  1972) or in the imports column (in 1972 and 1977). The non-
"comparable imports are recorded at the foreign port value, and the trans-"
oceanic  margins  are recorded  in the  appropriate  industries.  One  should
note that if the transport (or other activity recorded as a margin) is accom-
"plished  by a foreign  carrier,  it is a comparable  import  of  services and is"
dealt with accordingly. The specific treatment for comparable  imports  de-
pends on whether they are (1) intermediate inputs or (2) for final demand.
"Intermediate 
inputs: 
In the BEA tables prior to  1972 (in a manner simi-"
"lar to the treatment of secondary products), comparable imports of inter-"
mediary  goods  are  added  as  inputs  to  the  industry  that  would  produce
"them  in the  United  States.  In the  1972 and  1977 tables,  comparable  im-"
ports  of  intermediary  goods  are  separately  recorded  as  negative  entries
"in a special column of the final demand reserved for imports. In this case,"
the imports must be valuated in a unit as close as possible to the value of
the same commodity on the domestic market; they are therefore recorded
"at their value at the domestic port of  entry, duty included."
The details provided for the tables prior to 1972 are sufficient  to present
the comparable imports of  intermediary goods  in the new  methodology.
Although the details of the operations necessary were not included in the
"written publication of the BEA, they were available in the  magnetic-tape"
data files. The comparable imports of  the earlier tables must be valuated
at their domestic-entry  port value by adding the transoceanic margins to
their foreign  port value. These amounts  are then written with a negative
sign in the new column of the final demand reserved for imports. In order
"to  maintain  the  balance  of  accounts,  the  addition  of  transoceanic  mar-"
gins must be compensated for by subtracting them from the industry that
"produces the margin services (transportation, wholesale trade, and insur-"
ance).  Since  the  imports  are  recorded  with  a  negative  sign  in  the  new
