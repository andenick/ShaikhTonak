,The transfers between the primary and secondary sectors can take place,
,"directly when the former  pay royalties (ground rent, interest, etc.) to the",
,"latter. Or they can take place indirectly, when (say) the households who",
,"derive their  revenues  from  the primary sectors (as wages, dividends, in-",
,"terest  payments,  etc.) in turn  pay over  some portion  of these  revenues",
"to the royalties sector.  In either case, since the original sources of these",,
,secondary-sector revenues are already captured in the accounts of the pri-,
,"mary sectors, we cannot count them again in the measure of total value.",
,"By the same token, since the total product is produced and realized in the",
,"primary sector, we cannot count the revenues received by secondary sec-",
,tors  as measures  of  some  additional  production  emanating  from  these,
,sectors. Thus we cannot count them in the measure of total product. Sec-,
,"ondary flows are part of total transactions,  but not part of total value or",
total product.,,
,Note that this does not mean that we ignore the actual use of the prod-,
,uct by the secondary sector or by households whose incomes derive from,
,it.  Royalty  payments  are deductions  from  the purchasing  power  of the,
,primary sector and its associated households. Their receipt by the secon-,
,dary sector enhances that sector's purchasing power and that of its asso-,
,"ciated households. What the former  sector loses, the latter gains. In this",
,way the redistribution of value brought about through transfers between,
,the primary and secondary sectors leads to a changed use of the product.,
