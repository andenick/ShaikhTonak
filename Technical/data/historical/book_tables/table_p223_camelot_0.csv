,Phillips's economic surplus is essentially the sum of after-tax  property-
"type income, the wage costs of  unproductive activities, all taxes, plus the",
government  deficit  (since  government  expenditures  equal  taxes  plus  the,
"deficit). In years where the deficit is small, as in the postwar years covered",
"by  his data,  this is basically  the  same  as  (NIPA)  value  added  minus the",
wages of  production  workers.  Thus  Phillips's  measure of  economic  sur-,
plus is conceptually similar to that of surplus value. We will see in Figure,
"6.10 (to follow)  that the two are quite close,  empirically.",
,Stanfield  (1973)  tackles  the  estimation  of  the  surplus  in a much  more
"consistent  manner.  He  approaches  it  from  the  use  side,  as  indicated  in",
Table 6.11. He also incorporates Phillips's suggestion that the output fore-,
gone due to unemployment  ought to be taken into account.  Thus he de-,
fines potential  surplus  as  potential  (full  employment)  output  minus  the,
"sum of personal and social essential consumption, whereas actual surplus",
is actual  output  minus  personal  and  social  essential  consumption  (Stan-,
"field 1973, pp.  1, 81). He notes that Phillips's estimates are somewhat in-",
"consistent,  since they inexplicably  ""relegate all property incomes  and all",
"government expenditures to the economic surplus,"" thus implicitly assum-",
ing that neither supports any necessary expenditures.  His own  approach,
assumes that property-type income is partially expended on essential cap-,
"italist consumption,  just as a part of  government  expenditure  represents",
"essential public consumption (p. 86). By itself, this makes his measure of",
"economic  surplus  smaller  than  that  of  Phillips.  On the  other  hand,  his",
measure  of  the  essential  consumption  of  workers  is  much  smaller  than,
"their actual consumption, which tends to expand his measure of economic",
,surplus. We will  see that the net effect  is to make his measure  somewhat
