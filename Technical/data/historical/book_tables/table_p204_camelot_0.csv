Critical analysis of previous empirical studies,185
"1978, and that they generally rise over time. On the whole, his estimates",
"of the rate of surplus value are much smaller than ours would be, largely",
because his measure of variable capital includes unproductive workers in,
the productive sectors as well as all workers in the trade sectors. For in-,
"stance, we calculate the rate of surplus value in the United States in 1978",
to be 207% (Table H.I). If we were to instead use Gouverneur's measure,
"of (NNP â€” Wpt)VWpt, with Wpt = all wages in productive and trading sec-",
"tors, we would get a rate of surplus value of  81%  for the United States  -",
very much the order of magnitude that Gouverneur obtains.44,
The next set of NIPA-based estimates of the Marxian aggregates comes,
"from  Moseley  (1982, 1985). Like  Shaikh,  he is concerned  to  emphasize",
the  crucial  difference  between  the  rate  of  surplus  value  and  the  profit/,
wage ratio. He notes that his methodology for measuring variable capital,
"""is broadly  similar  to that  in Mage (1963) and  Shaikh  (1978)"" (Moseley",
"1985, p. 75, n. 1), except that he includes one-half  of trade sector wages,",
and mistakenly includes all agricultural wages and a fraction  of the wages,
"of  government  administrative  employees,  in variable  capital.45  But like",
"Mage and Shaikh, he too fails to include any portion of the wage equiv-",
"alent  of  productive-sector  proprietors  and  partners  in variable  capital,",
"so that  his estimate is about  7% smaller than ours (Moseley 1985, p.  71,",
table A.I).,
Moseley identifies Marxian gross value added with the nonimputed GDP,
"of capitalist businesses. As defined  in NIPA, the business sector includes",
"government enterprises (and of course agriculture), but excludes govern-",
"ment  administration  and households and institutions. From this, Mose-",
ley  further  excludes  all  imputations  included  in business  GDP.  By and,
"large  this  is correct,  because  it  ends  up  eliminating  the fictitious entry",
