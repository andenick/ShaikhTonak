,"he argues,  coming  primarily  from  Japanese agriculture itself.  Hence the",,,,,
,finding  that the realized rates of  surplus value are higher for  Japan than,,,,,
,for  the  United  States  does  not  necessarily  contradict  his opposite  result,,,,,
,for produced rates of surplus value (pp. 14-16). Table 6.9 presents Izumi's,,,,,
,"estimates of the value rate of surplus value, together with Khanjian's as a",,,,,
,reference  point  for  the  United  States.  Note  that  Izumi's figures for  the,,,,,
,United  States  are lower  than  those  of  Khanjian  by 20%-35%  owing  to,,,,,
,the former's  inflation  of  the measure of  the value of  labor power (which,,,,,
,is discussed further in what  follows).,,,,,
,Izumi's inclusion of the value of  the unproductive sector's total (direct,,,,,
,and indirect) materials requirement Cm^ within the value of  labor power,,,,,
,is quite unnecessary.  The problem arises because he does not  adequately,,,,,
,"address the content of the category of ""services."" To the extent that some",,,,,
,"part  of  the  service  sector  consists  of  productive  activities,  it  should  be",,,,,
,directly included  within the productive  sector (as we have done).  On the,,,,,
,"other hand, we have shown that unit values calculated from actual input-",,,,,
,"output tables are really labor-value/producer-price  ratios, so that the la-",,,,,
,bor  value  of  a  commodity  bundle  such  as  the  wage  basket  of  workers,,,,,
,must  be  calculated  as  the  product  of  these  value/producer-price  ratios,,,,,
,and  the  producer-price  component  of  the  commodity  bundle.  Because,,,,,
,"such a calculation uses neither the trading margin nor the royalty flows,",,,,,
,it seems to exclude unproductive activities simply because they are unpro-,,,,,
,ductive. But this is an illusion. Trade margins are excluded because modern,,,,,
,"input-output  tables are constructed in terms of producer prices, which is",,,,,
,why the unit-value calculations yield value/producer-price ratios. If these,,,,,
,tables were constructed in terms of purchaser prices then they would yield,,,,,
,"labor-value/purchaser-price  ratios,  and  the  corresponding  commodity",,,,,
,elements in any bundle would also have to be valued at purchaser prices  -,,,,,
,so that trade margins would now be included. The exclusion of  royalties,,,,,
