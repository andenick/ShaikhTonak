known.  But  empirical  studies  typically  encompass  both  issues.  For  in-,
"stance,  the  early  studies  by  Wolff  (1975,  1977a)  estimate  both  the  labor",
value magnitudes and their money forms on the assumption that all wage,
labor is productive. This is tantamount to assuming that the money  forms,
"of Marxian categories are the equivalent to IO-NIPA categories, because  -",
,as  we have  seen  in  Section  3.1.1 -  the  mapping  between  the  two  is one-
"to-one  when  all labor  is treated  as productive.  On the other  hand,  later",
,"studies  by Wolff  (1977b,  1979, 1987) and  Khanjian  (1989) do  distinguish"
"between  Marxian  and  IO-NIPA  categories,  since  they  incorporate  the",
distinction  between  productive  and  unproductive  labor  in  their  estima-,
tion  of  value categories  and their money  forms.,
,The impact of price-value deviations on the relation between the money
and value measures of the rate of surplus value has already been analyzed,
(in  Section  5.10)  and  shown  to  be  an  entirely  secondary  consideration.,
"Accordingly,  in  this  chapter  we will  group  the  studies  under  review  ac-",
cording  to  the  manner  in  which  they  treat  the  distinction  between  pro-,
ductive and unproductive labor. Thus Wolff's  earlier studies are placed in,
the category of those that  fail to distinguish between Marxian and  NIPA,
"categories,  while  his  later  studies  and  the  one  by  Khanjian  fall  into  the",
category  of  those  that  do  make  such  a  distinction.  The  issue  of  price-,
value deviations will then be addressed as it crops up. Figure 6.1 provides,
a graphical  summary  of  our  schema of  categorization.,
