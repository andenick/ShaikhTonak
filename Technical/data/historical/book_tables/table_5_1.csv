"comparable imports consistent across years. Second, these 82 x 88 tables",nan
were aggregated  into  8x11 summary  tables  constructed  in the  form  of,nan
Figure 5.1 above. Details are in Appendix A.,nan
"As indicated  in  Figure  5.2,  total  value TV is simply the sum of  the",nan
gross outputs  of  the production  and total trade sectors (the sum of  the,nan
elements in the bold rectangle). Materials used up in production C& and,nan
"intermediate  productive  use UJ  are now both  net  of  depreciation  (i.e.,",nan
nan,"CJ = C — Depreciation and U^ = U — Depreciation), and so are simply"
"equal to MJ,, the sum of the first two entries in the top left-hand  corner",nan
of  Figure 5.2.  Marxian gross value added  GVA = TV-C  is the sum,nan
of the downward hatched elements (including M[t) within the dashed rec-,nan
"tangle. Finally, the commodity uses CON, I j, X -  IM, and G are cal-",nan
"culated directly from those elements of consumption CON, gross invest-",nan
"ment  IG,  net exports X —IM, and government  expenditures G which lie",nan
within the Marxian final-use dashed rectangle.,nan
"By way of contrast, the IO measure of total gross product GP, which",nan
"is really the sum of all transactions, is the sum of all intermediate inputs",nan
(including  royalty  payments)  and  all final demand  GFD  (shown  as the,nan
column  sums of  the elements within the gross final-demand block). GP,nan
"appears  as the lower  right-hand  element  of  the  IO table,  and  GFD ap-",nan
pears directly above it.,nan
Comparisons between the elements of corresponding Marxian and or-,nan
thodox measures make it clear that TV will always be less than GO (since,nan
"the former is a subset of the latter), but that GVA may be less than, equal",nan
"to, or greater than GFD (because GVA excludes some elements in GVA",nan
and  includes  others  which  are  not  in  GVA).  Similar  remarks  apply  to,nan
use-side comparisons.,nan
Table 5.1 summarizes the calculations of Marxian and IO measures for,nan
"1972, in millions of dollars, as derived from Figure 5.2. Table 5.2 repeats",nan
these calculations for each of the benchmark years in which input-output,nan
tables are available. Note that the orthodox measure GP (the sum of all,nan
input-output  transactions)  is consistently larger than the Marxian mea-,nan
"sure of total product TP. On the other hand, the orthodox and Marxian",nan
"measures of gross value added (GFD and GFP, respectively) are surpris-",nan
ingly close: roughly equal in 1947 and roughly 11 apart by 1987.,nan
"5.2  Annual  series for primary measures, based on NIPA data",nan
nan,Our  previous  IO benchmark  estimates in Table 5.2 can be con-
verted into annual series by making use of National Income and Product,nan
Accounts (NIPA) data. Such a conversion is complicated by two factors.,nan
