A useful  supplementary measure concerns the relation between total sur-
plus  value  and  the  portion  absorbed  by government  purchases  of  com-
modities and of  (administrative)  labor power. Government  purchases  of
"commodities  directly absorb  a portion  of  the surplus  product,  and gov-"
ernment  administrative  employment  indirectly  absorbs  another  portion
through the consumption  expenditures  of  government  workers (see Sec-
"tion 3.2.B). Thus, total government expenditure G£ s  G* 4- WG is a mea-"
sure of  the total absorption of  the surplus product by unproductive gov-
ernment expenditures.  Table K.I  shows G£ and G£/SP*  for the postwar
period (where SP* = Marxian surplus product).
