Aglietta distinguishes between productive and unproductive labor.  How-
"ever, he believes that price-value deviations make the money form of the"
rate of  surplus value  a biased indicator  of  the trend of  the value rate of
"surplus value. For this reason, he sets out ""to find a more faithful  statisti-"
"cal indicator [of the] long run trend"" in the rate of surplus value (Aglietta"
"1979, p.  88). He concludes that the share of  real wages in productivity is"
a  more appropriate  measure of  the share of  the value of  labor power in
"labor value added, assuming that social productivities (the reciprocals of"
the unit labor values) of the consumer and producer sectors rise at roughly
"the  same  rate in the long  run.  To see this,  we will  derive his results in a"
"somewhat  different  way.  Using  our  own  notation,  the  share  of  produc-"
tion worker wages in current-dollar value added can be written as
v*' = Wp/VA = (w-Hp)/(py-VAr) = (pc wr)/(py-y) = (pc/py)-(wr/y)f
where
VA = current-dollar  (NIPA)  net output  (value added);
