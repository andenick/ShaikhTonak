clude that Wolff's inconsistent procedure creates an upward bias in the es-,
timates of  S*/V* of  about  12%-15% (in years common to both studies).,
,There are several other features to be noted. Wolff's mapping between
"Marxian and input-output  categories  is partial,  because it is confined  to",
the use side alone.  His estimates  of  rates of  surplus value are  somewhat,
"higher than ours, because he subtracts income taxes from his measure of",
productive worker wages but fails to add in government social benefit ex-,
"penditures. This reduces his measure of variable capital (1977b, p. 112). He",
also implicitly treats all income of unincorporated enterprises as property-,
"type  income,  since  he  makes  no  provision  for  subtracting  out  the  wage",
"equivalent  of  self-employed  persons.  Finally,  it  is  striking  that  Wolff",
"(pp.  87-9,105,108-12)  repeatedly treats the Marxian measure of the sur-",
"plus product as synonymous with the Baran-Sweezy concept of ""surplus,""",
although he also argues (p. 97) that unproductive activities can be neces-,
"sary.  We will  see in Section  6.3  that  the two concepts  are very  different,",
which becomes quite clear when we compare the respective empirical pro-,
cedures involved.,
,"Wolff's  second  attempt  comes  in  his  1987  book,  which  is  a  rich  and"
interesting  extension  of  his earlier analysis.  It attempts to  provide  a  full,
double-entry accounting of the relation between Marxian and input-output,
categories.  It shows  that  U.S.  employment  and wage bills  of  unproduc-,
"tive labor rise relative to that of  productive  labor in the postwar period,",
and develops a formal  two-sector model of their effects  on  accumulation,
"(1987, pp. x-xi,  chaps. 4-5).  Productive labor is now distinguished  from",
"unproductive labor within the productive sectors (p.  80, n.  19), and only",
the wages of the former are counted as variable capital. The treatment of,
"taxes on variable capital is also improved,  since only the net tax on labor",
(the difference between taxes paid by labor and social benefit expenditures,
"directed  toward  labor)  is  deducted  from  wages  (p.  78).  Finally,  Wolff",
"distinguishes  the rate of  exploitation  from the rate of  surplus value, and",
introduces a valuable method of  calculating the former  (p. 84). As in his,
,"earlier work,  Wolff (1977b, pp. 87-89) identifies the Marxian surplus prod-"
uct  with  Baran-Sweezy's  surplus.  But  in contradistinction  to  his  earlier,
"position,  he  now  identifies  unproductive  activities  as  unnecessary:  ""the",
labor  power  provided  by  unproductive  workers  is  not  essential  for  the,
"production  of  any output"" (p, 78).",
,The core of Wolff's book is his double-entry accounting framework. But
"once again, the framework  he presents is symmetric between money and",
"labor  value  calculations.  As  in  his  earlier  work,  Wolff  treats  all  unpro-",
ductive activities as part of  a general royalties sector (he uses advertising,
