,"We have already seen that, at one extreme, use values emerging from a"
process  of  production  may  be  productively  consumed  (re-entering  into,
"another production process  as its material inputs); at the other extreme,",
they may be personally consumed. What we need to examine now is their,
use in distribution or in maintenance of  the social order.,
,"In  order  to  forestall  any  possible  confusion,  we  should  note  that  we"
"use the term ""distribution"" to cover only those activities  (not  necessarily",
"firms) which transfer the use values, titles, or money from one set of indi-",
"viduals to another.  We have already argued,  for instance,  that transpor-",
"tation can be either productive or distributive, depending on its context.8",
"By  the  same  token,  a  particular firm may  encompass  both  distribution",
activities and production  activities  (as in the example of  advertising that,
follows).,
,"Generally  speaking,  distribution  involves  the  utilization  of  some  use"
values  as  material  inputs  in  a  process  that  transfers  the  ownership  of,
(other)  use values  from  their  immediate  possessors  to  those  who finally,
"intend  to  use  them.  As  such,  the  labor  involved  in  this  process  brings",
about the circulation or distribution of  pre-existing use values by chang-,
"ing their possession. Thus, although distribution activity does  transform",
"the use values it circulates, this transformation  relates to their properties",
"as  objects  of possession  and  appropriation,  not  to  the properties  which",
define them as objects  of social  use. A cashier who charges you money is,
performing  a very different  activity  from  the singer  who  sings the  song.,
"The latter activity results in the use value itself, while the former circulates",
titles to it. A song heard for  free is all the more sweet to the listener. But,
"then,  of  course, the seller hears a different  tune altogether.",
,"Advertising  and sales activities have the same character,  because their"
,"aim is to change not the use value itself but rather the knowledge of,  and"
"desire for, this use value. They therefore attempt to locate, enhance, and",
create  the  effective  demand  for  this  use  value  so  as  to  transfer  title  to,
(sell)  it  on  as  profitable  terms  as  they  can.9  This  in  no  way  precludes,
