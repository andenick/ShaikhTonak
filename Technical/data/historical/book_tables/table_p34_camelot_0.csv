"durable  items  (plant,  equipment,  and  durable financial assets)  but  also",
nondurable  items  (inventories  of  materials  and work  in progress as well,
as short-term financial assets).  It is because money is tied up as capital  -,
be  it  in  the  form  of  durable  goods  or  short-term financial assets  -  that,
the possibility of profit arises. The substantial profits made in speculation,
and  trade  make  it  clear  that  the  durability  of  the  investment  is  a com-,
pletely secondary matter.,
,"The goods  of  a household,  both  durable and nondurable,  are part  of"
the  consumption  circuit; those  of  the government  are part  of  social ad-,
"ministration.  To reduce  business,  household,  and  government  stocks  to",
mere durable goods  is to  negate the differences  between capitalist  enter-,
"prise, personal  consumption,  and social administration.21  To impute fic-",
titious  gross  profits  to  the latter two  only compounds  the problem.  In a,
"similar vein, while it is perfectly proper to assess the skill and  knowledge",
"of the population, and perhaps even to cumulate the total cost of acquir-",
"ing these attributes, it is not appropriate to treat the resulting measure of",
"imbedded cost as yet another stock of  ""capital.""",
,Business  R&D  expenses  and exploration  costs  are a different  matter;
they are a part of the circuit of capital. The question here is whether they,
should be reclassified as fixed investment expenditures (rather than current,
"costs or circulating investment), and then cumulated to form some stock",
"of intangible business capital. In this regard, it is useful to note that R&D",
"and similar expenses are, after all, exploratory expenditures which may or",
"may not bear fruit.  By treating them as current costs, businesses already",
take account of the expense when it is incurred. And if they do bear fruit,
"at some time in the future, the resulting capital investment is counted when",
,"it is made,  as are any associated  profits  if they in turn appear.  An  artifi-"
cially constructed stock of intangible R&D capital is therefore redundant.,
,Eisner lists several other major modifications  specific to particular au-
"thors. A significant number (NT, Z, JF, K) expand their measures of total",
output  by  a  large  amount  representing  the  estimated  output  of  leisure,
"time; since leisure contributes to utility, it is appropriate within neoclassi-",
"cal economics to view it as a production activity (Eisner 1988, p. 1626).22",
