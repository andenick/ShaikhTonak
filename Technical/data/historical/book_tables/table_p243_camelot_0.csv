"on theoretical grounds, Wolff's estimates of money rates of surplus value",
are  uniformly  higher  than  his  labor  value  estimates  by  about  4%-8%,
"(Wolff  1977b, p. 103, table 3, lines 1 and 3). On the other hand,  Khanji-",
an's estimates indicate that SVV* is uniformly  lower than S/V by about,
"6%-9%  (Khanjian  1988, p. 109, table 19). This allows us to estimate that",
Wolff's  inconsistent  procedure  biases  the  money  rate  of  surplus  value,
SVV*  upward  by  12%-15% (the  sum  of  the two  sets of  differences  in,
years common to both Khanjian  and  Wolff).,
,The calculation of labor-value/producer-price ratios also enables us to
distinguish  the rate of  exploitation  from  the rate of  surplus value. The,
rate of  exploitation  is the ratio of  surplus labor time to necessary labor,
"time.  This  concept  applies  to  all  capitalistically  employed  wage  labor,",
whether it be productive or unproductive. Necessary labor time is simply,
"the value  of  the  labor  power  involved  -  that  is, the  labor  value of  the",
average annual basket of commodities consumed per worker in the activ-,
ities in question.  Surplus  labor  time is the excess of  working time over,
"necessary labor time. For productive workers, their rate of exploitation is",
"also  the  rate  of  surplus  value,  since their  surplus  labor  time  results in",
"surplus value. We derive expressions for both ratios, show how they are",
"connected, and derive a simple method of empirically estimating the rate",
of  exploitation  of  unproductive  workers  (Section 4.2). At  an  empirical,
"level, the two rates move in remarkably similar ways, with only small  dif-",
ferences in levels: the rate for unproductive labor starts out lower than that,
"of productive labor, principally because of higher wages for the  former,",
"but  the gap disappears  by the mid-1970s. Both  rise strongly  over time,",
"always staying within 10% of one another (Section 5.6, Figure 5.18).",
