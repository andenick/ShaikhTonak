"concerned  with  the  actual  flows  of  royalties  into,  and out  of,  the  actual",
flow of  variable  capital.  This  is what  Ursula  Hicks  (1946)  has called the,
"statistical  or ""social accounting calculation"" of taxes:",
,We arrive thus at two  fundamental  concepts  in fiscal  theory: (i) the so-
,cial accounting  calculation  of  the proportions of  people's incomes paid
,"over to taxing authorities in a defined period, and (ii) the analysis of all"
,the economic adjustments through time and space resulting from a par-
ticular tax. These two concepts are different  in kind,Social account-
,ing is concerned  with a statistical  comparison  at a moment  of  time . . .
,the analytical  concept  is essentially  hypothetical.  It is a com-
,"parison of  two complete economic  situations,  one with a particular tax"
,"in force, the other without it. One of these setups will normally be imag-"
"inary.  (U.  Hicks 1946, p. 49)",
,"We do not attempt here to estimate the analytical  or ""tax-shifting"" inci-"

the  comparison  between  the  actual  level  of  some  income  and the hypo-,
thetical  alternative  level  that  might  exist  in  the  absence  of  some  taxes.,
It is  a  further  stage  of  analysis  which  requires  some  plausible  model  of,
the overall impact of  taxes on reproduction; such models are beyond the,
,scope  of  our  present  analysis.  Thus  we concern  ourselves  only  with  the
