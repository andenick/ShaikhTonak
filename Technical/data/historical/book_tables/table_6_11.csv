,"a  Stanfield's  real surplus measure is based on his real actual surplus (1973, p.  81,",,,,
,"table  7-6) and the ""ratio  of  surplus  elements  in market  prices to GNP"" (called",,,,
,"s/p;  p. 58, table  5-14).  Since his real  actual  economic  surplus was  calculated at",,,,
,"cost  prices, the following  formula,  after  converting  1958 dollars to 1982 dollars,",,,,
,was  used  in order  to translate  his surplus figures to the ones  in market  prices:,,,,
,[surplus in market prices] = [surplus in cost prices] x [1/(1 â€” (s/p)}].,,,,
,b  Phillips's  real  surplus figures are based on his current-dollar  estimates  (Baran,,,,
,"and  Sweezy  1966, p. 389, table  22);  they are converted  to real figures by using",,,,
,GNP  deflators  (1982 = 100).,,,,
