"measure v"", based on our own data, is indeed a good proxy for the long-",
term trend  of  the  (true)  unit  value  index  v*'.  Thus Aglietta  is correct  in,
"his theoretical claims for such an approximation, even though (as we have",
argued)  the  relatively  small  impact  of  price-value  deviations  makes  it,
"unnecessary.  We also  see  that  Aglietta's  own  index  w',  as  derived  from",
,"his Diagram 1 (Aglietta 1979, p. 91), is a fair proxy for our index v*': both"
"indicate  a rising  rate of  surplus  value  (i.e.,  a falling  unit value  of  labor",
"power)  until  roughly  the  mid-1960s,  and  an  apparent  change  in  trend",
"after  that.  However,  it is clear that shorter-run movements are not at all",
"similar.  These  latter  movements  are  quite  important,  however,  because",
"within  his  theoretical  framework  they  are  supposed  to  be the  ""essential",
"determinants  of  the  ups and downs  of  accumulation"" in the ""regime  of",
"predominantly  intensive  accumulation""  which  supposedly  characterizes",
the postwar U.S.  economy (p. 203). Given the crucial role played by this,
"index,  it  is  quite  sijrprising  that  he  fails  to  document  the  sources  and",
"methods involved in its construction. We will not pursue the issue further,",
"except to note that within our approach it is the rate of profit, rather than",
"the rate of surplus value, that drives the long-term patterns of  accumula-",
tion (see Chapter 7 and Shaikh 1992a).,
,Gouverneur (1983) presents a rich and subtle treatment of capitalist pro-
duction and profit.  He distinguishes between the production and circula-,
"tion of use values, between value-producing and  surplus-value-producing",
"labors, and between services that are part of  commodity production and",
"those  that  are part  of  circulation  (""commercial  and financial business"")",
"or social  administration  (""education,  justice,  defence,  etc.""). He is care-",
ful  to  note  that  unproductive  capitalist  employees  also  perform  surplus,
"labor  (1983, pp. 73-7). Like Eaton,  he assumes that the net tax on labor",
"is zero: ""we are going to assume quite simply that the wage-earner's share",
in the financing of  collective  products  is equal  to their share in the con-,
"sumption of them"" (p. 69). At an empirical level, he assumes that the con-",
"ventional measure of value added represents the Marxian measure of ""new",
"revenue created (in monetary terms),"" and defines variable capital as the",
estimated wage bill of productive workers and self-employed persons (pp.,
"93,  243, 246).43 On this basis, he calculates real (constant-price)  rates of",
"""surplus  labour""  for  France,  Germany,  Belgium,  Netherlands,  and  the",
United  Kingdom.  He finds that  these  rates  range  from  62% to  98% in,
