the two sets of measures is an index of the aggregate impact of purchaser-
price-labor-value  deviations. Table 5.12 shows that  these differences  are
"minor, ranging from  6 to 9. Note that the value rate of surplus value"
is always smaller than the money rate (although they have the same trend).
This is apparently due to the fact that the prices of consumer goods have
higher  trading  markups  than  the average  bundle  of goods  in net out-
"put  (consumer  goods  pass  through  both  wholesale  and  retail  channels,"
"whereas investment goods do not). By construction, the price of the aver-"
age commodity  is equal to its value.23 The relatively  greater  markup  of
consumer  goods tends to make their  purchaser  prices higher  than  labor
"values,  leading to a money  form  of variable  capital  V which is higher"
"than the value of labor power V, as well as a money rate of surplus value"
"S/V which is lower than the value rate S/V  (Khanjian  1989, pp. 109-13)."
The small and stable differences  between the value and money rates of
"surplus value implies that their trends are virtually identical. Figure 5.25,"
"which plots the use-side measures of the two rates, makes it abundantly"
clear  that  the  money  rate of surplus  value is an  excellent index of the
value rate of surplus value.
