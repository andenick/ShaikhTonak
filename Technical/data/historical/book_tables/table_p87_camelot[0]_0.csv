price below  its value.  The  difference  between the two  sets of  sales is the,
revenue of the domestic trade sector (the total trading margin on all goods,
sold).  This  holds  even when  commodities  are sold to their final  users at,
(purchasers')  prices proportional  to their values.,
,Exactly  the  same  thing  occurs  when  a  domestic  producer  exports  a
"commodity.  In this case,  however,  the value transferred  to the trade sec-",
"tor may be split up between domestic and foreign trading capitals, so that",
only  a portion  of  the total  value is retained  within the country.  Exports,
"therefore  transfer  value  out  of  a  nation,  ceteris  paribus,  in  an  amount",
equal  to  the  trade  margin  of  the  foreign  trading  capital.  The  opposite,
holds  for  imports.  The  domestic  trading  capital  captures  a  portion  of,
,foreign value by acquiring a commodity below its final selling price (which
by assumption  is equal to its value).  Imports transfer value into  a coun-,
