"workers - that is, to what orthodox economics would call disposable ""fac-",
"tor incomes."" This is what accounts for his falling rate of surplus value in",
the postwar period.,
The first systematic derivation  of  the relation  between Marxian cate-,
"gories and national income accounts appears in the work of Shaikh (1978b),",
who  begins  from  the  distinction  between  productive  and  unproductive,
labor and builds up to the various forms of the circulation of value. He is,
"also the first to  adjust  the rate of  surplus value for  the net tax (""social",
"wage"") on labor. The present book is an extension of this earlier work.",
,Shaikh (1978b) emphasizes the critical importance of having empirical
categories that  correspond  to the theory under consideration  (pp. i-iii).,
He derives the Marxian distinction between productive and unproductive,
"labor  from  more general considerations  (pp. 1-11), and then shows how",
this  fundamental  distinction  affects  the  relation  between  Marxian  and,
orthodox economic categories (pp. 12-31). Beginning with only produc-,
"tion  activities,  he successively  introduces  trading,  rental, financial, and",
governmental  activities.  Each  stage  in  the  argument  is used  to  further,
,concretize the mapping between Marxian and NIPA categories. His  final
result is essentially the same as the revenue side of our present approach,
"(p.  30). As Shaikh notes, the total value of the final product  appears as",
"the gross product of ""the productive sector and trading sector... because",
these are the only two sectors through which the commodity-product  it-,
"self passes on its way to its realization as money"" (p. 31). Constant capital",
"is the intermediate inputs of the productive sector, and variable capital is",
the  wage bill  (after  net  taxes)  of  productive  workers  in the  productive,
sector. All of  the rest  of  total value is surplus value (pp.  30-1). Shaikh,
emphasizes the great conceptual and empirical difference  between the re-,
"sulting ""rate of surplus value and . ..  its fetishized  form,  the profit-wage",
