"a  A naive measure of surplus value would be the sum of all profits, rents, interest, and taxes:"
S'=VA + (RYp + RYtl + RYry)-W = P + IBT + (RYp + RYtt + RYry). We make use of  this in
our technique for approximating the rate of  surplus value in Section 5.12.
"b Total  consumption  CON = CONWp + CONWnp + CONC,  where  CONWP = consumption"
"of  productive  workers,  CONWnp = consumption  of  all  other  workers,  and  CONC = con-"
sumption of  capitalists. Thus CON-CONW p = CONWnp + CONC.
"c  As is evident from the discussion in the text, the Marxian measure of consumption CON"
"excludes the transfer payments RYcon, HHcon, and ROWcon, while the conventional measure"
of  consumption  CON  includes  them.  Thus  CON = CON-RY c o n-HH c o n-ROW c o n.  The
"expressions for  I, (X â€”IM), and G are derived in the same way."
