"Mage (1963) bases his calculations on ""the aggregate non-farm private busi-"

"ernment,  government  enterprises, and private households and  nonprofit"
"institutions (p. 161); finance, insurance, and real estate (pp. 165,181); and"
"professional  services  (pp.  165, 183). What  remains  is mining,  construc-"
"tion,  manufacturing,  transportation,  communication,  utilities,  produc-"
"tive services, and wholesale/retail trade, which is simply his definition of"
capitalist production and trade (i.e. primary) sectors. His own method of
deriving this estimate of the primary-sector gross product is to build it up
by separately  estimating  its various  components  from  a variety  of  data
"sources  (Mage  1963, chap. VI and  apx. to  chap. VI). But it could  have"
been derived far  more easily in a direct manner.1
We begin by deriving the NIPA estimate of  GDP in the primary sec-
"tors, and then compare it to Mage's own capitalist-sector gross product,"
as shown in Table M.I.2
Mage's estimate is somewhat  larger  than  the direct  NIPA  equivalent.
"To  see why,  it  is useful  to  break  down  Mage's  measure  into  categories"
comparable  to  those  of  NIPA-IO  GDP;  see Table  M.2.  The  sole con-
ceptual difference  between Mage's measure and the equivalent NIPA one
arises  from  the items under  the heading of  net interest  and net rent. As
