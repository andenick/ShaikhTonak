Methodology  of  the input-output,database,239
"table  into  two  tables.  The first table,  known  as the Use  table,  describes",,
,the  use  of  the  different  commodities  by  the  different  industries  and  the,
,"functions  of  the  final  demand;  the  second,  or  Make,  table  displays  the",
production of  each commodity by the different  branches.,,
,"In order to unify the treatment of  secondary products in the six tables,",
,this third method was also applied to the earlier tables. These operations,
,were carried out at the highest degree of  detail possible: 79 industries  for,
,"1947  and  1958,  and  368  industries  for  1963  and  1967.  The first problem",
,"involves a number of specific redefinitions: from 1972 on, and contrary to",
,"what was done before, the electricity produced and sold by the manufac-",
,"turing,  mining,  and  railroad  sectors  is  systematically  redefined  as being",
,produced by the electricity industry. The same is true for the reselling of,
,"commodities taking place in the manufacturing  sector, which is redefined",
,"as occurring in the wholesale trade industry,  and for rents and royalties,",
,"which are systematically redefined into the real estate industry (BEA1980,",
,"p.  49).  In the studies  before  1972, these ^classifications  were dealt  with",
,"by using the transfer method, therefore implying the opposite assumption",
of  constant-industry  technology.,,
,"For  published  tables  that  report  only  the  total  transfers  by  industry,",
,magnetic-tape  data files are available  (distributed  by the BEA) that con-,
,tain the detail of the transfers by commodity and industry.  It is therefore,
,possible  to  use either  of  the two  assumptions  of  constant  technology.  It,
,is important to realize that the information in the transfer table is equiva-,
,lent to that included in the Make table.  The transfers  indicate the quan-,
,"tity of secondary products produced by each industry. On the other hand,",
,a  table  without  the transfers  represents  the  direct  allocation  of  primary,
,products  and  their  use  by  the  different  industries  and  functions  of  the,
,final demand; the row totals  of  this table represent  the total  production,
,of  each commodity.  By comparing  these totals  and the column totals  of,
,"the transfer table, it is possible to calculate the quantity of each commod-",
,ity which is produced as the primary product of the corresponding indus-,
,try.  This  is accomplished  by calculating  the differences  between the two,
,sets of  totals.  It is therefore  possible  to  use the transfer  table to  rebuild,
,"Use and Make tables  for  years prior to  1972, although the  manipulation",
of  the two matrices is quite complicated.,,
,By  systematically  applying  the  assumption  of  constant-industry  tech-,
,nology  to  the  secondary  products  described  outside  the  main  diagonal,
,"of  the  Make  matrix,  it  is  possible  to  rebuild  an input-output  table that",
,"describes  the  transactions  between  industries.  Of  course,  these  transac-",
,"tions are made of  heterogeneous  commodities,  since primary and secon-",
,"dary products are mixed together. To obtain such a table, it is enough to",
,pre-multiply  the Use table by the column coefficients  of  the Make table.,
