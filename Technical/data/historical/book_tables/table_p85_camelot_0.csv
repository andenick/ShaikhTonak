,debate that  concerns  the  welfare  state  and  the so-called  social wage or,
,citizen wage (Bowles and Gintis 1982; Shaikh and Tonak 1987). It should,
,be  noted  that  our  analysis  of  state-induced  transfers  deals  with  actual,
,"empirical flows -  that  is, with  the  observed  incidence  of  taxes  -  corre-",
,"sponding  to what  Ursula  Hicks  (1946) has called the ""social  accounting",
,"approach."" The further  analysis of tax incidence based on some assumed",
,"pattern of tax shifting, which would involve a comparison between the ac-",
tual flows and some hypothetical alternative set of flows deemed to hold,,
,"in the imagined absence of some taxes, is beyond the scope of this book.",
3.4  Foreign trade,,
,We have tracked down the various forms taken by produced value,
,"as it is absorbed  by the trade, royalties, and state sectors by means of a",
,complex series of value transfers. But this was for a closed economy. The,
,question now is: How are these results modified  for an open economy?,
,"In the case of  an open economy,  our object  is to distinguish  between",
,domestically produced  value  and  domestically  realized value.  The  dif-,
,ference  between the two arises from  transfers  of value which cut across,
,national  boundaries. There are three basic causes of these international,
,"transfers: foreign trading margins on exports and imports, which transfer",
,"value between nations; deviations between purchasers' prices and values,",
,"which do the same thing; and international flows of wages and salaries,",
,"dividends, interest, et cetera, which transfer  value directly in the form of",
,money. The first two issues will be addressed  in the treatment  of  inter-,
,national  commodity  trade  (merchandise  trade  accounts)  and  the  third,
,"in that  of international payments for  ""factor  services"" (rest-of-world  ac-",
,"counts). Before we proceed, however, we need to specify  what we mean",
by national economic boundaries.,,
,The precise distinction between domestic and foreign  economic activ-,
,"ities depends on the purpose of the analysis. For instance, we can define",
,"""domestic"" in two basic ways: in terms of the national boundaries of the",
,country  involved;  or  in terms  of  the nationality  of  the person  or  orga-,
,"nization in question. We will adopt the former,  because our purpose is to",
,measure the production  of  value within a given nation.  This use of  na-,
,tional boundaries to define domestic activities implies that location takes,
,precedence over nationality. Thus foreign workers or corporations located,
,within the United States are counted as part of the domestic sector.,
,Transportation activity involves a further consideration. A cargo loaded,
,onto  a  domestic  carrier  can  cross  over  to  foreign  territory  before  it is,
,"unloaded at its foreign destination. Along the way, it may cut across the",
,"territory of  some third nation,  or cross neutral space such as the ocean.",
,"Alternately,  the  domestic  carrier  may  hand  over  its cargo  to  a  foreign",
