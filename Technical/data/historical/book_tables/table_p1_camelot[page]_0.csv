This book provides an alternate foundation  for the measurement
"of the production of nations, and applies it to the U.S. economy"
for the postwar period. The patterns that result are significantly
different  from  those derived within conventional  systems of na-
tional accounts.
Conventional  national  accounts  seriously  distort  basic  eco-
"nomic  aggregates  because  they  classify  military,  bureaucratic,"
"and financial activities as creation  of  new wealth.  In fact,  these"
"authors  argue, such aggregates should  be classified  as forms of"
"social consumption  which,  like personal  consumption,  actually"
use up social wealth in the performance  of their  functions.
The difference  between the two approaches has an impact not
"only on basic aggregate economic measures, but also on the very"
understanding  of  the  observed  patterns  of  growth  and  stagna-
"tion. In a world of burgeoning militaries, bureaucracies, and sales"
"forces, such matters can assume great significance at the levels of"
both theory and policy.
