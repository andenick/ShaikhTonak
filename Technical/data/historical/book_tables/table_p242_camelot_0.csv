"the wages of production workers, the measure of variable capital changes.",
Although the calculation of  net interest and net ground-rent payments is,
"conceptually  straightforward,  the estimation of  net taxes paid requires a",
comparison between the gross taxes paid by production workers and the,
"corresponding transfers and other social welfare expenditures (for health,",
"education,  roads,  parks,  etc.)  directed  back  toward  them.  To the extent",
"that the net transfer is positive, it reduces the measure of variable capital",
and increases the measures of surplus value and the rate of surplus value.,
,Although we do not estimate the net interest or ground rent paid by pro-
"ductive  workers,  we do  calculate  the  net transfer  between them  and the",
"state. For the United States, the taxes paid turn out to be generally larger",
"than the social benefits  received -  that is, there is a net tax paid by labor.",
"This  implies  that  true  variable  capital  is  somewhat  lower,  and  the  true",
"mass and rate of  surplus value somewhat  higher, than the apparent rates",
"(Section 5.9, Figures 5.23-5.25). Interestingly enough, even though actual",
"government purchases of the total product G* rise substantially over time,",
they  actually  decline  relative  to  the  mass  of  surplus  value  from  1955  to,
"1989 (Section 5.8, Table 5.11 and Figure 5.21). Nonetheless, the total gov-",
"ernment absorption of surplus value GÂ£ = G* + WG remains fairly stable,",
"relative to surplus value,  over this same interval.",
,All  of  these  mappings  were  constructed  on  the  assumption  that  pur-
chasers' prices were proportional to labor values. This allowed us to check,
"that  the  various  elements  add  up  to  the  correct  totals,  no  matter  how",
complicated the transfers of value involved.  It also ensured that any dis-,
crepancies  that  arose  between  individual  Marxian  categories  and  their,
"orthodox  counterparts  were due  solely  to  conceptual  differences,  not  to",
any  price-value  deviations  that  might  exist.  In Chapter  4 we extend the,
analysis  to  the  calculation  of  actual  labor  value  magnitudes.  We  show,
"that the correct procedure is consistent, in the sense that it gives the same",
,ratios  in  value  terms  and  in  price  terms  when  unit  purchaser  prices  are
equal to unit values (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). This means that in actual input-,
"output  tables,  where  purchaser's  prices  generally  do  differ  from  values,",
we can then interpret the deviations between value and money ratios as a,
"measure  of  the  aggregate  effects  of  price-value  deviations,  if  the  pro-",
cedure used is consistent  in the sense just described.,
,"Using the consistent  procedure,  Khanjian (1989) shows that value and"
"price rates of surplus value differ by only small amounts (6%-9%), which",
indicates that the effects of price-value deviations on aggregate measures,
,"are quite minor (Section 5.10, Table 5.12, and Figure 5.25).  On the other"
"hand,  the  procedure  used  by  Wolff  (1977b,  1987),  who  also  attempts  to",
construct  a mapping  between  input-output  accounts  and Marxian cate-,
"gories, is inconsistent and is therefore biased (Section 6.2.3). As expected",
