"gap  appears  to  narrow  over  time,  and  why the  estimated  value rate of",
surplus  value  falls  over  time.  His estimate  of  the value rate  of  surplus,
"value is biased upward relative to the level of the profit/wage  ratio, but",
biased downward relative to its trend (to the extent that the gap narrows).,
,The second problem arises from the fact that Wolff ignores the distinc-
tion between productive and unproductive labor. We have seen that even,
"when prices are proportional to values, so that the correct measure of the",
"money rate of surplus value is equal to the corresponding value rate, the",
profit/wage  ratio can be a downward-biased  index of both the level and,
the trend  of  this true money rate of  surplus value. The same reasoning,
applies to Wolff's  value rate (which is his labor equivalent of the  profit/,
wage ratio) vis-a-vis the true value rate (computed using only productive,
labor).  Thus  we can  say that  the  level of  Wolff's  value rate  of  surplus,
value is lower than  the level of the true value rate (owing to the  failure,
"to distinguish between productive and unproductive labor), and that his",
profit/wage ratio is doubly lower (since its level is downward biased rela-,
tive to his own measure of the value rate). The impact on trend biases is,
"not  so clear,  because the two factors  seem to operate in opposite direc-",
"tions in this particular  study.  In any case, Wolff's  results must be inter-",
preted in the light of all of these considerations.,
,The conclusion that Wolff's  use of relative wages as indexes of skills is
the principal source of the great discrepancy between his value and money,
estimates  is borne  out  by  his  subsequent  studies  on  the  United  States.,
"There, by using labor coefficients  directly (Wolff  1979, p. 332, n. 9) with-",
