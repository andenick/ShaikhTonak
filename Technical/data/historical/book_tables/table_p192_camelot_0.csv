,,,,Figure 6.6.  Ratios of sectoral rates of surplus valuer to the aggregate,,,,
,,,rate. Source: Table 6.2.,,,,,
,"like Gillman in his second set of estimates, they focus their attention only",,,,,,,
,on that part of surplus value which takes the form of profit-type income.,,,,,,,
,"Gillman  muddied  the waters by labeling this ""net  surplus value.""28 The",,,,,,,
,"LRA pamphlet compounds the confusion,  and contradicts its own earlier",,,,,,,
,"usage, by simply calling it ""surplus value.""29  Its initial potential  is thus",,,,,,,
,dissipated by later contradictions and  confusions.,,,,,,,
,A much  more  consistent  treatment  appears  in  Eaton  (1966). Eaton's,,,,,,,
,"approach is generally quite sophisticated. At a theoretical level, he defines",,,,,,,
,Marxian  value added  as the value  added  in productive  sectors plus the,,,,,,,
,"gross trading  margin  on this output,  and  defines  variable capital  as the",,,,,,,
,"wages of  workers in the productive sectors (p. 211, including  footnote).",,,,,,,
,This is essentially the same as our own revenue-side measures shown in,,,,,,,
,Table 6.4 (to follow).30 Eaton also points out that variable capital should,,,,,,,
,,,28  Gross and  net  national  product  are gross and  net  of depreciation.  Gross  surplus,,,,,
,,,,value  is gross  of  depreciation.  It is therefore  plausible  that  net surplus  value,,,,
,,,should  be net of depreciation.,,,,,
,,,"29  They  call the ratio of profit-type  income  to variable capital  ""the national  rate  of",,,,,
,,,"surplus value"" (Labor  Research Association  1948, pp.  27-8).",,,,,
,,,30  Our  measure can be written  as VA = (RYP + VAp) + GOt.  If Eaton's  measure of,,,,,
,,,,"productive  value  added  includes  rental  and  finance  charges  (royalty  payments),",,,,
,,,then  his measure is the same as ours.,,,,,
