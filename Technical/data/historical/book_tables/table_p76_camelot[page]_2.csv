3.2.2  Profit-type,income  can exceed surplus  value
,We have seen that whereas royalty payments by primary sectors
to  secondary  sectors  tend  to  reduce  the measure  of  profit-type  income,
"relative to surplus value,  similar transfers  originating in household, gov-",
"ernment,  or foreign  sectors  (i.e.,  in nonbusiness  sectors)  tend  to make",
"profit-type  income larger relative to surplus value. At an empirical level,",
the profit-reducing effect of transfers of value swamps the profit-increasing,
effect.  But the very fact  that two such opposing  effects  exist implies that,
we cannot  say a priori  whether or not surplus value will be greater than,
,total profit. This only serves to emphasize the theoretical point that aggre-
gate  profit  is the sum of  realized  surplus  value  and the net transfer  of,
value between circuits of capital and circuits of revenue (see Section 2.4).,
