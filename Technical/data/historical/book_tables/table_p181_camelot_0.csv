"trend of the rate of exploitation in the United States. However, as we shall",,
,"see, Mandel and Perlo provide the correct figures for the postwar period.",
,"Despite the surprising calculation errors in his later data, Varga's basic",
,approach is very advanced. He not only distinguishes between production,
,"and nonproduction workers in manufacturing,  but is also careful to note",
,"that  his  estimate  of  the  rate  of  surplus  value  ""is  lower  than  the  actual""",
,rate because it fails to account  for surplus value transferred  from manu-,
,facturing  to  the  trade  sector.  It is  only  the  lack  of  adequate  data  which,
,"prevents him from correcting  for this effect  (Varga 1964, p. 107).",
,"Varga's methodology  was adopted  by Corey  (1934) and Varley (1938),",
,"with very similar results (Sharpe 1982a, p. 30). Gillman (1958, pp. 33, 39)",
,"takes  up the same approach  for  his primary measures,  defining  variable",
,capital  in  manufacturing  by  the  wages  of  production  workers  and  sur-,
,plus  value  as  the  rest  of  value  added  (he  measures  surplus  value  both,
,gross  and  net  of  depreciation).  Gillman  provides  three  sets  of  estimates,
,"of  the  rate  of  surplus  value  extending  from  1849 to  1952,  although  no",
,single  set covers the whole  period  owing to  a lack  of  consistent  depreci-,
,ation estimates for the entire interval.13 He also looks at the various com-,
,"ponents  of  surplus value,  such as unproductive  expenses  and ""property-",
,"type""  income.  This  aspect  of  his  work  is  discussed  separately  in  what",
follows.,,
,"Mandel  (1975,  pp.  174-5)  further  develops  the  Varga  method.  In  his",
,"theoretical discussion, Mandel makes several important points. He begins",
,by noting the difference in structure between Marxian economic categories,
,"and  conventional  ones.  The  salaries  ""of  managers,  higher  employees  in",
,"industry and the state apparatus"" belong in the measure of  surplus value",
,"(p.  165), as do the taxes paid by capitalist firms (p.  176), while that por-",
,tion of the business and personal revenue which is the result of the recir-,
,culation  of  primary  sector  flows  is  excluded  from  the  measure  of  the,
,"social  product  because  it  represents  ""revenue  which  has been  spent  two",
