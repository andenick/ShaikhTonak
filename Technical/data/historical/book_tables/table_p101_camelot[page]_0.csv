actual input-output  tables are constructed in terms of money flows eval-,
"uated in producer prices, not quantity flows. This means that instead of",
input quantity coefficients  a/y we actually have input money value coeffi-,
"cients app = P/-app/y/py, where p/, py represent producer prices. The cor-",
responding  labor  coefficients  are  hp = hpy/py.  Our  empirical  equation,
for labor values now reads:,
A = hp + A.app;,
"A = hp(I-app) 1,",
where the estimated  unit values A  now represent  labor-value/producer-,
"price ratios (Shaikh 1984, apx. B). We have:",
,A = the row vector of labor-value/producer-price ratios;
"A=A/py,",
where,
Ay = unit labor values;,
py = unit producer prices.,
,"Since the As are ratios of labor values to producer prices, we must be"
careful to apply them only to the producer-price components of commod-,
ity flows. Thus the labor value of productive inputs C is derived by multi-,
plying the producer price of the /th  input  by the  labor-value/producer-,
"price ratio A. In terms of Figure 4.1, this means that the labor value of",
constant capital is calculated by multiplying only the matrix of elements,
"(Mp)p by A. Yet the corresponding money value of constant capital C,",
"which is the purchaser  price of  productive inputs, is equal to their pro-",
ducer price (Mp)pplus,the trading margin on these same inputs (Mp)t. In
"our previous examples, in which purchaser prices are equal to labor values,",
the two magnitudes C and C will be equal under this calculation proce-,
dure. The difference  in their mode of calculation is due solely to the fact,
that input-output  tables are cast in terms of producer prices.,
,The same issue arises in the calculation  of the labor value of produc-
tive labor  power V. Given some estimate of the consumption  basket of,
"production  workers CONWP, the labor value of this is the labor-value/",
,producer-price ratio vector A multiplied only by the producer price com-
"ponent  (CONWp)p (see Figure 4.1). On the other hand, the money value",
equivalent V is the sum of both the producer-price elements (CONWp)p,
