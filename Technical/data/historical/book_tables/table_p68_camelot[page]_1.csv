Figure  3.6.  IO accounts and Marxian categories: Production and trade.
the final purchaser's price of  any input is decomposed into its producer's
"price and its trading margin,  and the two components  are recorded sep-"
"arately  as  ""goods"" purchased  from  the  producing  sector  and  ""trading"
"services"" purchased  from the trading sector (BEA  1980, pp. 19-20)."
"In our  numerical  example,  the total  value  of  the aggregate  product  is"
split  between  producer's  price  and  gross  trading  margin  in  the  propor-
"tions  1000:1000 =  1:1.  For  simplicity  in  constructing  our  IO  table,  we"
will  assume  that  the  same  split  holds  for  each  individual  component  of
"the  total  product.  On  this  assumption,  each  commodity  purchase  (M,"
"CONW,  CONC, and I) appearing in Figures 3.4 and 3.5 will be recorded"
"as two equal ""purchases"" from the production and trade sectors, respec-"
"tively.  The  row  sum  of  all  these  commodity  trade  margins  is the ""gross"
"product""  of  the  trade  sector  in  input-output  terminology,  and  this  of"
"course  is  the  same  as  the  corresponding  column  sum  of  its  input  costs,"
"wages, and profits  (its total revenue or ""gross output""). The resulting IO"
"table is depicted  in Figure 3.6,  with our usual conventions  for represent-"
ing the various Marxian measures.
The translation  from  the  Marxian  value  and  use-value  flows  depicted
in Figures 3.4 and 3.5 to the conventional  input-output  mappings in Fig-
ure  3.6  brings  out  the  difference  between  the  two  theoretical  bases.  A
"glossary  of  terms  is  provided  next,  and  Table  3.6  summarizes  the  alge-"
braic and numerical relations between the two sets of measures as derived
from Figure 3.6.
