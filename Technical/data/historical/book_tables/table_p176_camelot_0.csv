,Weisskopf  (1979)  concerns  himself  with  both  the  cyclical  and  secular

"explicitly identifies ""variable capital with the total wage bill  surplus",
"value with the volume of profits,""6 and net output with the NIPA measure",
of  net  output  (value  added).  He  also  implicitly  assumes that  all labor is,
"productive,  since  he  defines  productivity  as  real  net  output  per  unit  of",
"(all) labor (pp.  342-6).7  Not surprisingly,  Weisskopf finds that the ""long",
