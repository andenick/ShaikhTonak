tween Marxian categories and national economic accounts occurs in the
pamphlet  by the LRA  (Labor  Research  Association  1948). The bulk of
"the empirical estimates in this pamphlet are sectoral, which is why it was"

"ductive sectors (pp. 22, 27-8). This is not exact (among other things, the"
"intermediate inputs of the trading sectors would be left  out, the royalties"
"sectors would be double-counted in Marxian value added, and unproduc-"

"but it is a start in the right direction. On the basis of their own remarks,"
the LRA pamphlet should have estimated variable capital as the wages of
"(all) workers in the productive  sectors, and  surplus value as the rest of"
