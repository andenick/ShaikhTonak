,Table B.I  bears out  our earlier analysis  (Sections  3.1.2 and 3.6)  of  the,
general patterns in the mapping between Marxian and IO-NIPA  catego-,,
,ries.  The  IO  measure  of  gross  output  GO = $2250  now  overstates  total,
,"TV* =  $2000, because the $250 transferred from the primary sectors to the",
,royalty sector is counted in orthodox economics as a measure of the cor-,
,responding amount of production  by the royalties sector (since orthodox,
,"economics treats all sectors as production sectors).9 Similarly,  intermedi-",
,ate inputs M = 900 and total wages W = 700 overstate (respectively) con-,
,"stant capital C* = 400 and variable capital V* = 200, because the conven-",
,"tional  measures  encompass  all labor  and all inputs,  not  only  productive",
,"ones. On the other hand, total profit P = 650 considerably understates sur-",
,"plus value S* =  1400, because the former reflects only that portion of sur-",
,"plus value which takes the  form of  aggregate profit,  and not the portion",
,absorbed in the costs of unproductive capitalist activities (compare the last,
,expression  for  S* in Table B.I  with the corresponding expression for P).,
,"As  a result,  the  orthodox  measure  of  the profit/wage  ratio P/W  = 93%",
,greatly  understates  the  rate  of  surplus  value  SVV* = 700%  (and  hence,
,greatly understates the true rate of  exploitation  of  productive workers).,
,B.2.2  Royalty  payments  between  businesses and  households,
,,In addition to making (net) royalty payments directly to the roy-
,"alties  sector,  businesses  also  make  such  payments  to  households.  These",
,"are recorded as disbursements  from value added, since they are not costs",
,of  operations.  Households  in turn make  (net)  payments  to the  royalties,
sector.  We will treat these two phases separately.,,
,Ignoring  (for  the moment)  their possible  impact  on the true wages  of,
,"productive  workers  and  hence  on  the  magnitude  of  surplus value,  busi-",
,ness  royalty  payments  to  households  merely bring about  a different  dis-,
,tribution of  surplus value and surplus product.  Figure B.9 makes it clear,
,that  we  pick  up  these  royalty  payments  in  the  value-added  rows  of  the,
,production  and  trade  sectors.  Figure  B.10  shows  the  corresponding  use,
side.,,
,"In  this  particular  case,  the  input-output  tables  treat  the  issue  in  the",
,"same way  as we do.  That  is to  say,  business  royalty  payments to  house-",
,holds are picked up in the value-added rows of the production and trade,
,"sectors,  and  the  corresponding  distribution  of  the  product  shows  up in",
,the final-demand columns.  Figure B.ll  shows the IO-Marxian  mapping.,
,"The general patterns here are the same as before,  with the exception that",
