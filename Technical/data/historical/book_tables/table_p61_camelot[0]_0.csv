"money  sum,  say  4000  ""currency  units"" (CU).  The  total  labor  value  of",
2000 hours is expressed in 4000 CU of money. But we can always redefine,
"the  unit  of  money  to  be  equal  to  2 CUs,  name this new  unit  a ""dollar,""",
and say that the total selling price of 2000 hours of value is 2000. While,
"this is merely a notational device, it simplifies our exposition by allowing",
one  magnitude  (with  differing  units)  to  represent  total  labor  value  and,
"also  its  monetary  expression,  the total  selling  price  of  the product.  The",
"term ""value"" will therefore be used for both labor value and its monetary",
"expression,  unless we wish to explicitly distinguish them.",
,"Once  we  introduce  trading  activities,  we  need  to  distinguish  between"
the  producer's  price  (the  price  at  which  the  product  is  sold  by the pro-,
