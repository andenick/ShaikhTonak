Figure 6.4.  Estimates of the rate of surplus value: Manufacturing.
Source:  Table 6.2.
Figure  6.4  graphs the main ones.  The preceding  studies have two  salient
"characteristics.  First  of  all,  like  all  sectoral  estimates  they can only pick"
up that  portion  of  aggregate  surplus value realized in a particular  sector
"(generally manufacturing). At best, this would represent only the realized"
"rate of surplus value, net of any value transferred into or out of it to other"
"sectors. This is why so many authors,  from Varga onward, are careful  to"
point out that their sectoral estimates are underrepresentative  of the true
rate of  surplus value. To the extent that these transfers have a trend over
"time, the resulting estimates will have secular bias."
An entirely  separate problem  arises from the fact that census data are
constructed  quite  differently  from  NIPA  data.  Table  6.3  illustrates  the
problem for the year 1970 by comparing census and NIPA figures for gross
value added and total employee compensation in manufacturing.  The cen-
sus figures for gross value added are typically larger than the correspond-
"ing NIPA figures (by 19 for  1970). At the same time, census figures for"
employee compensation and production worker wages are typically smaller
than  NIPA-based figures (roughly  20 smaller  in 1970). Both these  fac-
tors serve to  make census-based  estimates  of  the sectoral  rate of  surplus
