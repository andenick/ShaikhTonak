"Money  value flows

(positive or negative) transfers of value between the (flow) circuit of capital
"and all other circuits (see Section 2.4).  In the present case, the disburse-"
ment of  dividends out of  the profits  of  the production sector is recorded
"as a sharing out of profits, not as a deduction from it (unlike payments of"
"ground  rent or net interest,  which  are recorded  as costs of  business and"
hence as deductions  from production profits).  Because dividend payments
"are not treated as deductions  from profits,  there is no recorded  transfer-"
out  of value from the circuit of capital. But when capitalists in turn pay a
"portion of this dividend income back to the business sector, the correspond-"
ing  business  receipt  constitutes  a  recorded  transfer-in  of  value  into  the
"circuit of capital, a portion of which then shows up as additional recorded"
profit.  It is the particularity of profit-loss accounting that gives rise to this
"effect,  not some mysterious creation or negation of  value in circulation."
Another way to look  at this outcome is to recognize that although sur-
"plus value is the foundation of modern capitalist profit, some components"
of total profit-type income are not derived from surplus value. The profit-
type  income  of  the  primary  sector  is  always  part  of  aggregate  surplus
"value  (see Figure 3.7 and Table 3.6); however,  the profit-type  income  of"
"the secondary sector is not included in surplus value, precisely because its"
sources are already contained within other parts of total value (captured
in  the  accounts  of  primary  sectors).  This  is  clearest  in  the  simple  case
in  which  there  are  only  production  and  royalties  sectors  (Figure  3.9).
"Here,  while  the  profit-type  income  of  the  production  sector  is  equal  to"
"surplus  value,  total  profit-type  income  is greater  because  of  secondary-"
sector  profits.
"In actual empirical  estimates  for the United  States, the abstract possi-"
"bility  pictured  here does  not  predominate.  Indeed,  aggregate  profit-type"
"is  roughly  60 of  total  surplus  value,  and  aggregate  profit
income  P +"
"P  is  40.  Moreover,  since  variable  capital  V  s W p  is  roughly  40  of"
"total  wages  W,  the  rate  of  surplus  value  SVV  is  generally  five  times"
greater than the profit/wage  ratio P/W  (see Section  5.4).

PUBLIC  SECONDARY  FLOWS: GENERAL  GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES"
"The  state  sector  as  a  whole  encompasses  two  types  of  activities.  First,"
there  are  government  enterprises.  Depending  on  the  particular  type  of
"activity  in  which  they  engage,  such  enterprises  appear  in  IO-NIPA  ac-"
