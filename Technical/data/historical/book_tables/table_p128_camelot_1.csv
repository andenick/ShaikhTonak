LU = L â€” Lp = total unproductive labor.
7  We should  in principle attempt  to separate out production  from  nonproduction
"activities in the nonproduction  sectors, just as we do for production  sectors, but"
"the data for this is lacking.  Also,  there is a genuine asymmetry between produc-"
tion  and nonproduction  sectors.  All capitalist  enterprises  must  devote  a certain
"amount of their activities to buying and selling and to finance; thus, even produc-"
tive  sectors  will  contain  a  significant  amount  of  nonproduction  activities. But
nonproduction  sectors have no such systematic reason for incorporating produc-
tion activities.
"8  To estimate  the labor  in the productive  service  sectors,  we take the ratio of the"
"GNP  of  the productive  service  sectors  to the GNP of  total  services,  and apply"
that to the total  employment  in services (Table E.I and F.I).
9  Persons  engaged  in production  (PEP) is a standard  NIPA  series. The inclusion
of  self-employed  persons  alongside  full-time  equivalent  employees  suggests that
the former are also largely  full-time.
