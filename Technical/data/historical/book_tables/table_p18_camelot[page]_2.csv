,"The second period represents the Reagan-Bush era from  1980 to 1989,",,,
,in  which  the  capitalist  class unleashed  a  systematic  assault  on  workers',,,
,living standards and  working conditions  (see Section 5.9 for  further  de-,,,
"tails). The rise in the rate of surplus value accelerates over this interval, its",,,,
,"trend rate more than doubling. Moreover, the rates of growth of  C/V",,,
,"and  C/(V + S) slow down in this period, because the rate of  profit  is",,,
,still low and accumulation is slow (which in turn slows down the adoption,,,
,"of  new, more capital-intensive technologies). The overall effect  is to re-",,,
,verse the trends  in the three  measures  of  the rate  of  profit:  During this,,,
,"nine-year  interval,  the  Marxian  rate  of  profit  recovers  about  7  of  its",,,
,"initial (1948) value, the NIPA-based average rate about 5, and the cor-",,,
,"porate rate a mere 3. Table 5.9 summarizes these patterns, with trend",,,

,5.6  Rates of  exploitation of  productive and unproductive workers,,,
,The rate of exploitation is the ratio of surplus labor time to nec-,,,
,essary labor time. This can be calculated for any capitalistically employed,,,
,"wage  labor,  be  it  productive  or  unproductive.  Necessary  labor  time  is",,,
