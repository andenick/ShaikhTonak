Measuring  the  wealth of  nations,164
"the importance of this distinction is given great prominence (Mandel 1981,",
pp.  38-61).,
,MandeFs own contribution to the empirical discussion is to experiment
with  the  impact  of  a  broader  definition  of  variable  capital  on  Varga's,
methodology. He defines manufacturing variable capital in two ways (pro-,
duction worker wages and the former plus 50 of the salaries of nonpro-,
"duction workers),  and finds that the broader measure results in a slower",
but still rising rate of  surplus value.16,
,"Perlo (1974) further broadens the range of measures of variable capital,"
defining  it as production  worker wages in one case and as all wages and,
salaries  in  the  other.17  He  places  the  general  trend  of  the  gross  realized,
"rate of  surplus value somewhere in between, probably closer to the first.",
He also notes that  any measure of  the realized rate of  surplus value in a,
production  sector  will understate the level of  the true rate because  some,
"value is always transferred to the trading sectors (pp. 27-8). Finally, Perlo",
"argues that  ""monopoly  pricing  and promonopoly  taxation"" increasingly",
"benefit  capitalists  at the expense  of  workers,  so that the realized  rate of",
surplus value probably understates the trend of  the true rate. To correct,
"for this bias in the realized rate, he proposes to ""calculate the trend in the",
exploitation  of  labor by comparing  the physical  volume  of  the  worker's,
"production  with the volume  of  his consuming  power,  after  allowing  for",
"changing  retailing  prices and tax deductions  from  his pay"" (pp.  29-30).",
"In  practice,  this  means  estimating  the  trend  in  the  true  rate  of  surplus",
value from the ratio of  real take-home pay to labor productivity (p. 30).,
,"His ""index of worker's share"" is therefore much the same as what Aglietta"
"later calls the ""real social  wage cost.""18  The principal  difference  between",
"the two is that Aglietta apparently uses pre-tax real wages, whereas Perlo",
uses post-tax real wages. We may think of these as implicitly representing,
two alternate positions on the net tax (social wage) paid by workers: if one,
believes that  workers' taxes return to them in the  form  of  social  welfare,
