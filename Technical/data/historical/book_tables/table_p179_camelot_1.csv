preted in the light of all of these considerations.
The conclusion that Wolff's  use of relative wages as indexes of skills is
the principal source of the great discrepancy between his value and money
estimates  is borne  out  by  his  subsequent  studies  on  the  United  States.
"There, by using labor coefficients  directly (Wolff  1979, p. 332, n. 9) with-"
"out any adjustment  for skill levels, he implicitly assumes that the workers"
in each sector  in his input-output  tables all have roughly the same mix
of  skills. This is the opposite extreme from  his Puerto  Rico study. And
"here, the results are also quite different:  value and money rates of surplus"
"value differ  by only  8-15,  and  both  display the same general trend"
"(p. 334, table 1). His subsequent article with a different  definition of wages"
"yields essentially similar results, although in this case both measures de-"

"Khanjian  (1989, table 19) finds that price-value deviations result in varia-"
tions between value and  money rates of  surplus value of  only  6-9.
Thus price-value  deviations  do not  seem to pose a significant  problem.
"Of course, all the problems associated with the assumption that all labor"
is productive still remain.
"Wolff's  methodology  is  extended  by  Sharpe  (1982a),  and  applied  to"

"basic variables of  Marxian  economic analysis, Sharpe develops detailed"
estimates of these variables in both price and value terms. In his various
"estimates of the value rate of surplus value, he generally assumes that all"
