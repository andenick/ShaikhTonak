Table 3.6  (p.  50) makes it clear that  once we distinguish  between pro-
"ductive and unproductive activities, Marxian and IO-NIPA categories no"
longer correspond directly. Since the revenue sides are more similar across
frameworks  than  are  the  use-value  sides  (there  being  no  input-output
"equivalents of necessary and surplus product), we will focus our explana-"
tion  on the former.  Even at this level  of  abstraction we can identify  sev-
eral general patterns.
Production  and  trade  are  the  sectors  through  which  the  commodity
product is produced and realized. Their combined total revenue therefore
"represents the total price of the product TV. In input-output tables, this"
combined  total  revenue will  show  up as the sum of  the gross outputs  of
the  production  and  trade  sectors  GOP  and  GOt.  It  will  not  include  the
"revenues  (""gross output"")  of  any  secondary  sectors  (GOS)  because  such"
revenues  originate  in transfers  of  portions  of  the value flows of  the pri-
"mary sectors, and all such source flows have already been counted in the"
sector  of  their  origin.  Thus  we  will  always  find  that  total  value  TV =
"GOp 
+ GOt,  constant  capital  C =  MP,  variable  capital  V =  WP,  and"
productive  employment  equals  the  employment  of  capitalistically  em-
"ployed  production  workers  Lp  alone.  For  this  same  reason,  in  general"
each of  these Marxian categories  will always be less than their  orthodox
"counterparts GO, M, W, and L, respectively,  precisely because these lat-"
"ter measures count trade, ground rent, finance, and a host of  other non-"
production activities as forms  of  production.7
Other patterns in Table 3.6 will not necessarily carry over to the general
"case.  For instance,  the present  equality  of  Marxian total  value TV and"
