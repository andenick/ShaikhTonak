of unproductive workers:,,
,"In effect,  the relative rates of exploitation will depend solely on the rela-",

,"easily estimated  from  annual data.  In addition,  since the money rate of",
,surplus value is quite close to the value rate of surplus value (as shown in,
,"Section  5.10),  we can  substitute  S/V for  S/V  in the previous expres-",

,unproductive workers and compare it with that of productive labor. We,
,will see that in the United States the two rates remain within 10 of each,
