,The  second  problem  arises  in  Wolff's  attempt  to  distinguish  the  rate
of  exploitation  from the rate of  surplus value.  He introduces  a valuable,
method for calculating the average rate of exploitation of  all (productive,
"and unproductive)  workers (1987, p.  84). Using our notation,  let",
H = hours of all labor = Hp + Hu;,
(conw)p =  (column) vector of producer price components of the,
hourly consumption basket of the average worker;,
,"58  Wolff  (1987,  p. 133)  lists  only  estimates  of ""surplus""  per  worker,  which  do not"
,provide  enough  information   to calculate  his  implicit  estimates   of the  money or
value  rates of surplus  value.,
59  Wolff's  rationale  for  leaving   in social  security  taxes  is that  these  taxes,function
"like a pension  system  and eventually  return to working  class (1987, p. 62).  But  he",
"already accounts  for the reflux  of  such payments,  since he counts (p. 63) all direct",
,"transfers  to workers  as an addition  to wages  (actually,  as  a reduction  in net  taxes"
,paid).  This  is inconsistent  unless  social  security  taxes  are  among  the  taxes  de-
ducted  from  wages.,
