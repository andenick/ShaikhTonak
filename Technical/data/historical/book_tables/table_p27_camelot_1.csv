ing the coverage of financial flows beyond those directly tied to production.,
,"(this item can be negative, of course). To balance the accounts, the same amount"
,"is  treated  as  a  (positive  or  negative)  payment  by  the  unit  to  itself,  for  ""unin-"
,"tended  inventory  investment.""  This  is  typically  merged  into  gross  investment"
,expenditures.
,"6  Because the goal  of  NIPA  is to  measure the net  product,  they must  exclude the"
,portion of total product which is the equivalent of inputs used up in the year's pro-
,duction. To do otherwise would be double counting. But if the goal is to measure
,"the  total  product,  as  is  the  case  with  input-output  accounts,  then  obviously  it"
,would  be undercounting  to ignore input  use.  There is nothing  sacrosanct  about
,the net product as a measure.
,7  The proper measure of  net product  within conventional  accounts is net national
,"product  (NNP).  But since depreciation  measures are frequently  unreliable, pro-"
,duction accounts commonly leave depreciation (capital consumption) in the mea-
,"sure of net product (in value added on the revenue side, and in investment on the"
,use  side).  This  gross-of-depreciation  measure  of  net  product  is called  gross na-
,tional  product  (GNP)  if  it  refers  to  the  net  production  of  the  nationals  of  a
,"country  (including those who live abroad), and is called gross domestic  product"
,(GDP) if it refers to net production within a nation.
8,It is useful  to  note  that  the total  product  is a more general  and  useful  measure
,than the net product.  Two nations with the same net product per unit labor can
,have different  input requirements. Focusing on the net product alone would then
,"be  quite  misleading  when  considering  national  productivity,  employment  and"
,"resource use, etc."
