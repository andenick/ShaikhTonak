The classical and Marxian traditions share the distinction between produc-
tion and nonproduction labor. But Marx was particularly concerned with
"that portion of production labor which is productive of capital, since only"
this labor creates surplus value. The rest of labor is unproductive of capi-
"tal, even though it may be wage labor (in distribution and state activities)"
or production  labor  (productive of value or of use value). Marx himself
"does not imply that  productive labor is in any way superior to, or more"
"necessary than, unproductive labor. But as we pointed out in Chapter 2,"
"not all Marxists proceed in the same way. Most notably, Baran (1957, p. 32)"
"redefines productive labor as labor that would be necessary under a ""ratio-"
"nally ordered"" (socialist) society. Marx's definition  of productive labor is"
"thereby replaced with a definition based on necessity,1 and the concept of"
"surplus  value is replaced  with the concept  of  ""surplus"" -  defined  as the"
excess of the total product over essential personal and public consumption.
This chapter will analyze the various attempts to measure Marxian cat-
"egories. In order to make the account manageable, we restrict ourselves"
"to  studies  published  in English,  and  to  estimates  of  the rate  of  surplus"
"value. Sharpe (1982a) covers some of the literature available in French, but"
a comprehensive worldwide survey remains to be done. The Japanese are
pioneers in this regard. Izumi's brief survey of Japanese estimates makes
it clear that many of the issues taken up in the English language literature
"were first, and  often  better,  addressed  in the sophisticated  Japanese dis-"
cussion. Matsuzaki makes company-level estimates of the rate of surplus
