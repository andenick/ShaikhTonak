TP = U + NP + SP = 2000
"Because there is only one productive sector, the calculated A = 2 hr/"
should represent the ratio of the labor value of the total product TV to its
producer  price  GOP (the input-output  gross  product  of  the  productive
"sector).  This  is clearly  the  case,  because  by construction  TV = 2000 hr"
and GOP = 1000. Applying the formulas  in Table 4.1 to the numbers in
"Figure 4.2, we correctly recover the labor value flows (in hours of abstract"
socially  necessary  labor  time)  which underly the money flows depicted.
Table 4.2 displays the results.
"The mappings shown in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 are consistent,  in the sense"
that they give the same magnitudes in value terms and in price terms when
unit purchaser prices are equal to unit values (compare the value measures
of Marxian measure flows in Table 4.2 to their money value counterparts
"in Table 4.1). In this way, when prices deviate from  values, the resulting"
discrepancies  between  value  magnitudes  and  their  price  forms  are  due
solely  to  the  price-value  deviations  themselves.  In  actual  input-output
"tables,  where purchasers' prices generally do differ  from  values, we can"
then interpret  the deviations between value and money magnitudes as a
measure of the aggregate effects  of  price-value deviations. This effect  is
"generally small. For instance, using the procedure outlined here, Khanjian"
"(1989, p. 109, table 19) finds that the money rate of  surplus value S/V"
and the labor value rate S/V  differ  by only 6Â°7o-9  in all the years stud-
ied.  He  also finds that  the  former  is consistently  lower  than  the  latter.
Further details may be found  in Section 5.10.
