nan,It is possible to extract Wolff's labor value estimates of the average rate,nan
nan,"of  exploitation  e,  which is really the rate of  surplus value e as we would",nan
nan,define  it  (since  he  calculates  e  by  assuming  that  unproductive  workers,nan
nan,consume  the  same  basket  as  productive  workers).  He  presents  data  for,nan

nan,"Finally, Khanjian (1989) provides a set of consistent estimates of  labor",nan
nan,"value  and  money  rates  of  surplus  value  in  the  United  States,  based  on",nan
nan,"the  procedures  developed  in  Shaikh  (1975).  As  discussed  in  Section 4.1,",nan
nan,Khanjian's data clearly demonstrate that price-value deviations are small,nan
nan,in their effects  on the measurement  of  the rate of  surplus value: S/V  dif-,nan
nan,"fers from SVV* by only 6%-9%,  and the trends of the two are virtually",nan
nan,identical. This immediately implies that money value estimates of the rate,nan
nan,of  surplus value  are generally  excellent  proxies  for  the underlying  labor,nan
nan,value  rates.  But  Khanjian's  numerical  estimates  are  substantially  larger,nan
nan,"than  ours,  because  he  makes  no  adjustment  for  the wage  equivalent  of",nan
nan,proprietors and partners in the noncorporate sector. Such an adjustment,nan
nan,(which we do incorporate) reduces the measure of surplus value and raises,nan
nan,the measure of  variable capital.  This is also why our estimates are lower,nan
"than those in Wolff,  other things being equal.",nan,nan
