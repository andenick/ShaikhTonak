finds  that in general the less advanced regions of the capitalist world have,
"much  higher  rates  of  (realized)  surplus  value,  largely  because the wage",
gap is so much greater than the corresponding productivity gap (Amsden,
"1981, pp. 230-3).22",
"Lastly, Shaikh provides a long series on the gross-profit/wage  ratio in",
"U.S. manufacturing  from  1899 to 1984, a la Varga, as part of his analysis",
of  long waves. He finds that  this rate is essentially constant  in the pre-,
"Depression period  1899-1929, but rises steadily in the post-WWII period",
1947-84. This differential  pattern accounts for  a somewhat slower fall in,
the manufacturing  rate of profit  in the postwar period (Shaikh 1992a).,
,Almost all of these studies measure the rate of surplus value as the  dif-
ference between variable capital (defined as the sum of production worker,
"wages and possibly some portion of salaries) and value added. So defined,",
surplus  value is inclusive of  the materials  and  wage costs of  unproduc-,
"tive activities, of corporate officers' salaries and bonuses, of indirect busi-",
"ness taxes and corporate profit taxes, and of corporate and noncorporate",
"profits. Clearly, only a portion of surplus value takes the form of profits.",
We have emphasized this point  throughout.,
,Two further  sets of sectoral estimates center around the fact that profit
is only one component of surplus value. After  presenting his initial set of,
"estimates,  Gillman  (1958) goes  on  to  argue that  studies  of  profitability",
(such  as his)  should  concentrate  on that  part  of  surplus  value which is,
in excess of  such expenses as the materials and wage costs of unproduc-,
"tive activities.23 He calls this portion of surplus value ""'net' surplus value",
