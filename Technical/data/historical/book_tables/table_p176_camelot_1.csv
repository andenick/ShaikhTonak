"6.1.2  Aggregate 
labor  value  estimates"
Okishio  (1959) is the first to  estimate directly the rate of  surplus
value in labor value terms. Since he also distinguishes between productive

It  should  be  noted  that  although  the  Marxian  measure  of  productivity  differs"
"markedly from the conventional one in terms of its trend, the (short-run) cyclical"
"patterns of  the two  are quite similar  (Section  5.7,  Figures 5.19 and  5.20).  More-"
"over,  cyclical  fluctuations  in productivity  are quite modest  compared  with those"
"in real wages, so that cyclical patterns in the wage share of (all) workers may well"
mirror  corresponding  fluctuations  in  the  rate  of  exploitation.  Thus  Boddy  and
Crotty's  cyclical  results  may  not  be  substantially  altered  when their measure  of
productivity is replaced by a conventional one. But any attempt to link the short-
run cycles to longer-term trends would certainly be  affected.

"labor, but only because he believes the two types of employment exhibit  different"
cyclical patterns.
