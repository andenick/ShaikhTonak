Summary and conclusions,227
concludes that the money rate of profit is not likely to be a good indicator,
of the trend of the value rate. He therefore derives an alternate proxy for,
"this latter rate, in the form of ""real social wage cost"" of productive labor",
(the  ratio  of  the  real  wage of  production  workers to  the real  net value,
added  per unit  productive  labor). Although  this method  of  approxima-,
"tion is a valid one, it is of course dependent on having adequate measures",
of real production workers' wages and Marxian net product per unit pro-,
ductive labor. The trouble is that Aglietta nowhere explains how he gets,
,"his underlying data. We find that,  from  1948 to the mid-1960s, his index"
implies  roughly  the  same long-term  trend  as our  rate  of  surplus value.,
But  shorter-term  movements  are not  at  all similar.  These  discrepancies,
"are potentially important, because Aglietta places considerable weight on",
"explaining the ""ups and  downs of  accumulation"" from  the  shorter-term",
movements in the rate of surplus value (Section 6.2.2).,
,Okishio's  (1959) pathbreaking  work is the first to utilize  input-output
tables to estimate the money and value rates of surplus value separately.,
,In this initial study he treats all services as unproductive. He also inflates
his  measure  of  productive  worker  consumption  (and  hence of  variable,
,capital) by including within it some portion of the wages of unproductive
workers. Both factors lead to a downward bias in his estimate of the rate,
"of  surplus value, relative to  our  procedures.  Izumi (1980) also treats all",
"services as unproductive, and also makes an adjustment  like Okishio's to",
expand the definition  of the value of labor power. Okishio and Nakatani,
,(1985) reverse their  previous assumptions by treating all services as pro-
