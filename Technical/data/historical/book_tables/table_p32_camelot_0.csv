"Measuring  the  wealth of  nations

"(Z),  Jorgenson and Fraumeni  (JF), Kendricks (K), Ruggles and Ruggles"
"(R),  and Eisner (E). The latter two have already been discussed in some"
"detail. In what follows, we will focus on the major characteristics of these"
types of  accounts.
"In  principle,  orthodox  economics  defines  production  activities  as  all"
those  that  affect  the  welfare  (welfare  as  utility)  of  individuals  in  a na-
"tion  (Kendrick  1968, p.  24).16 In practice,  however,  official  accounts are"
"built  largely around market  activities,  supplemented  by imputations  for"
"the ""services"" furnished  by owner-occupied buildings,  services  furnished"
"without  payment  by  financial 
intermediaries,  and  some  small  imputa-"
tions  for  farm  products  consumed  on  farms  and  food  furnished  to em-
"ployees,  et cetera  (Eisner  1988,  p.  1620).17 Thus one  of  the central  tasks"
of  conventional  extended  accounts  is to  revise  and expand  the  measure
of  production  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  underlying  core  of  eco-
nomic theory (p. 1616).
The differences  among the various  accounts  arise solely  from the spe-
"cifics of this process. In particular, whereas most authors seek to measure"
"production  in  terms  of  activities  that  contribute  to  economic  welfare,"
"a  few  ""seek  explicitly  to  measure"" welfare  itself  (Eisner  1988,  p.  1627,"
"n.  15). Thus Nordhaus and Tobin, as well as Zolotas, reduce the measure"
"of  national product by their estimates of  ""regrettables and disamenities"""
"(Eisner 1988, p.  1670, table 1)."
Certain  themes  are common  to  almost  all  accounts.  Most  would  add
the  imputed  value  of  household  activities  and of  illegal  market  produc-
"tion  to  their estimates  of  the  national  product,  if  good  data were avail-"
"able (Eisner 1988, p. 1670, table I).18 Our own approach would be similar,"
