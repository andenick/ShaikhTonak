"of  capital,  and  to  short-term  fluctuations  arising  from  cycles  and  from"
"specific  historical  events  such  as  wars,  droughts,  and  so  on.  The  latter"
will  be  reflected  as  fluctuations  in  the  rate  of  utilization  of  the  capital
"stock, which show up as corresponding fluctuations in the mass of  profit."
"To eliminate this effect,  we divide the mass of profit by the rate of capac-"
"ity  utilization,  in  much  the  same  way  as  actual  output  is  traditionally"
divided by capacity utilization to estimate potential  output.
Table 5.8  and Figures 5.16 and 5.17 present the basic results. The data
are partitioned  into two major periods. The main period is from  1948 to
"1980,  during  which  the  rate  of  surplus  value  rises  modestly  by  almost"
"22, the adjusted value composition rises by over 77, and the adjusted"
materialized  composition  rises  by  over  56.  Because  the  large  rise  in
the value composition  overwhelms the modest  one in the rate of  surplus
"value, the adjusted Marxian rate of profit falls by almost a third over this"
"period. The NIPA-based average rate of profit r' falls even faster, by over"
"48,  and the corporate  rate the fastest  of  all, by over 57. These more"
rapid  declines  can  be explained  by the relative  rise in the proportion  of
"unproductive  to  productive  activities,  which  absorbs  a growing  propor-"
tion of  surplus value and reduces the amount available as profit  (see Sec-
tions 5.3  and 5.4).
