only  a portion  of  the total  value is retained  within the country.  Exports,nan,nan

nan,"Tables  3.9-3.11  illustrate  these  arguments.  In  Table  3.9,  we  see  that",nan

nan,the  total  value  of  the  product  (equal  to  its  purchaser's  price  of  $100) is,nan
nan,"split up between the production sector ($70), the domestic transportation",nan
nan,"sector ($10), and the domestic trade sector ($20). On the assumption that",nan
nan,"the  transportation  in  question  is  productive  transport,  a  total  value  of",nan
nan,$100 is created by the production  sectors (steel producers and transport-,nan
nan,"ers), of  which $20 is transferred  to the domestic trade sector by virtue of",nan
nan,the  fact  that  the  total  producers' price  ($80 =  $70+$10)  is  less  than  the,nan
