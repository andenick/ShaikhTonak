"California  to  New  York  is the  productive  leg  of  the journey,  because  it",
changes the objective  useful  properties  of  the orange. The loop  through,
New Jersey has no (positive) effect  on the useful  properties of the orange,
"as an object of consumption,5  but it does improve those properties which",
"affect the orange as an object of distribution. As such, this loop is internal",
to  the distribution  system.  It therefore  constitutes  distributive  transport,
"of  commodities,  a  nonproduction  activity.  A  similar  argument  can  be",
"made  for  business-related  transport  of  salespeople,  which would  be dis-",
tributive transport of  passengers.,
,"In  the  case  of  production  activities,  the  labor  involved  is  production"
"labor, which utilizes certain use values in the creation of  new use values.",
"As  products  of  this  labor,  these  new  use  values  are  quite  distinct  from",
either  the labor  or the  materials  that  went  into  their own  production:  a,
"song is not the singer, nor merely the medium of  air; cut and shaped hair",
,"is neither barber nor scissors,  nor uncut  hair; an orange in New  York is"
"objectively different,  as a New Yorker's object of consumption,  from the",
orange that began its journey in  California.,
,It should be evident that the definition of a use value has nothing to do
"with the conventional  distinction between goods and services.  Indeed, as",
"we shall see, the very term ""services"" conflates  a vital distinction between",
production and nonproduction labor. The preceding discussion also allows,
us to  clarify  a point  of  confusion  in the literature concerning  the  differ-,
ence  between  the  production  of  a use  value  and  its  subsequent  use.  We,
begin by considering the various alternative uses of  some given set of use,
values which have just emerged from  a production process.,
,"In the first place, use values may re-enter into another production pro-"
"cess as material inputs. A truck may be used in transportation, an orange",
"may be used in making  food,  a coiffure  may be part of  the  performance",
"of  a song. In all these cases, they are used up as part of a new production",
process involving fresh production labor and resulting in new use values.,
"The  original  use  values  are destroyed  (they  are productively  consumed,",
"in Marx's terminology),  but in the process new  wealth is created.  At the",
"other  extreme,  the  original  use  values  may  enter  directly  into  personal",
"consumption,  in which case they are used up in the process of  reproduc-",
ing the consumers themselves; they are individually  consumed.,
,Whether an orange is re-used in the further production of food or con-
"sumed directly,  it must first be produced  as an orange. This means that,",
"regardless of  the further use to which the orange is put,  the labor  which",
"originally produced 
it remains production",labor.  If it is re-used in further
