"production and use of wealth. But it is not appropriate, we would argue,",
"to conflate capitalist and noncapitalist surplus products, precisely because",
"the former  is the foundation  for  aggregate profit.  Moreover, it seems to",
"us ill-advised to treat economic surplus as a ""kind of discretionary  fund""",
"to be ""allocated among competing alternatives"" (Lippit 1985, p. 10; Stan-",
"field  1973, p. 3).",
,"In any case, economic surplus is generally derived by subtracting some"
"measure of essential social consumption  from  NNP, which assumes that",
NNP itself is an adequate measure of net product. Phillips (in an appen-,
dix to Baran and Sweezy 1966) arrives at the economic surplus by adding,
"together after-tax  property-type income, the wage costs of  unproductive",
"activities, all taxes, and the government deficit  (since government expen-",
ditures  equal  taxes  plus  the  deficit).  Because  the  government  deficit  is,
"small in the postwar years covered by his data, Phillips's measure amounts",
to the difference  between (NIPA) value added and the wages of produc-,
"tion workers, and is therefore  similar to that of  surplus value.  Stanfield",
(1973) attempts to account for the surplus foregone due to unemployment,
by defining  potential  surplus as full-employment  output  minus the sum,
"of  personal  and  social essential consumption,  in contrast  to actual  sur-",
"plus based on actual output (pp. 1, 81). On the whole, Phillips's measure",
of  economic  surplus  is much  closer to  surplus value than  is  Stanfield's.,
"Finally, Erdos (1970) provides an eclectic variation on these themes. His",
"measure is a kind of political economic surplus, even though he labels it",
"as (redefined) ""surplus value."" His stated intention is to modernize Marx-",
"ian categories by making them ""correspond  as exactly as possible to the",
"empirical  facts  of  our  days."" He defines  socially necessary costs as that",
"part of  ""new value"" which is not used by the oppressing class or the op-",
"pressive part of the state apparatus. At the empirical level, he defines new",
value as the (NIPA) value added in production and trade. Necessary costs,
"are defined  as the wages of  production  and  trade workers,  net of  taxes",
"and transfers, plus one-third of government wages (an estimate of the so-",
"cially useful  portion of government expenditures). The political surplus,",
,"which he calls surplus value, is the rest of new value. So defined, his mea-"
sure of  the rate of  political  surplus  in the United  States is even smaller,
"than Stanfield's  rate of economic surplus. Overall, measures of real eco-",
nomic surplus are somewhat lower than our corresponding measures of,
