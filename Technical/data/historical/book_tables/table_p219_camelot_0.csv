where,,
,"V = value of productive  labor power = n • H p,  and",
,Vu = value of unproductive  labor power = n • H u.,
,Wolff's measure of the average rate of exploitation e is the ratio of total,
,surplus labor time (H -  VT)  over the value of total  labor power V T.  This,
,"is clearly correct.  As  shown  previously,   it depends  only on  the  consump-",
tion  standards of the average worker  for  any given vector of value/price,,
,"ratios. By extension, the rate of exploitation  of productive workers would",
,be their  surplus  labor  time  ( H p - V)  over  the  value  of their  labor  power,
,"V. And if, as Wolff assumes,  productive workers' consumption  standards",
,"are the same as those of the average worker, 60 then the rate of  exploitation",
,of  productive  workers  would  be the  same  as that  of the average  worker.,
,But  the  rate of exploitation  of productive  workers  is the  rate of surplus,
,"value.  So, under  Wolff's  assumption  of equal  consumption  baskets, the",
,rate of surplus value would  equal the average rate of exploitation:,
