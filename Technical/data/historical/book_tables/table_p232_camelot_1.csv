and unproductive  (government- and trade-sector)  use.  We then find that,
the observed rate of  accumulation will fall  relative to the Marxian profit,
,rate when a greater portion of  surplus product is absorbed in personal or
social consumption.  We have:,
"gK = ( l - c c - g o v - e u ) ( S * / K *)  = (l-c /)-u.r*'=s /.u.r*',",(4)
,3  The path of  accumulation at normal capacity utilization is similar to what Har-
,"rod (1939, p.  16) calls the ""warranted"" path. In Marx, this is perfectly consistent"
with a persistent level of  unemployment (see e.g.  Goodwin 1967).,
,4  We can also combine equations  (1) and  (2) to  obtain the familiar  Kaleckian re-
,"lation  Pn = CONC + In + ( G - T ),  in  which  unproductive  expenses  E u  appear  to"
,"have  no  role.  But  this  is  an  illusion.  The  relation  of  (Pn + T)  to  S*,  and  of"
"(CONC + In + G) to SP*, is mediated precisely by Eu.",
