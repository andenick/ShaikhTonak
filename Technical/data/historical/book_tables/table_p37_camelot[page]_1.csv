interesting to note that within our accounting schema the above anomalies
would not appear. Neither the cleanup expenditures by industry or gov-
"ernment, nor the medical expenditures by consumers, would be counted"
"as  production  activities.  Indeed,  like  all  nonproduction  activities,  they"
would use up resources in responding to the environmental problem. As
"for  the environmental  degradation  itself, this could be counted  as a re-"
duction in the stock of (environmental) wealth.
"In any case, there exists no consensus on the appropriate treatment of"
environmental  issues within  any system of  accounts.26 But it is possible
to  address the somewhat  more manageable  issue of  resource depletion.
"Eisner (1988, pp. 1622-3) suggests that the improvement or exhaustion of"
natural resources be treated on a par with any other investment. Economic
activity  that  increases  the  value  of  land  or  natural  resources  would  be
"counted as investment, and activity that exhausts them would be counted"
"as depreciation. Repetto et al. (1989, pp. 22-4) propose a similar scheme,"
"in which the change in the physical stock of resources, valued at average"
"prices over the period, is added to net national product (as net investment"
or disinvestment). Such a procedure would reduce the measured net na-
tional product  when income is derived essentially from  the depletion of
resources.27
