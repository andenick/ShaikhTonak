In order to measure the net impact of state expenditures and taxes on the
"rate of surplus standard of living of wage and salary earners, we need to"
examine the net transfer  between these wage and  salary earners and the
state. This net  transfer  is defined  as benefits  received by workers minus
taxes paid.  In this appendix we briefly  outline the methods of  allocating
"various government expenditures and taxes to labor, and then report esti-"
mates of the net transfer  for the period 1952-85. Because the net transfer
"is negative  over  most  of  this  period,  it  actually  represents  a net tax on"
workers. What follows is a brief summary of the methodology in Shaikh
and Tonak (1987).
In determining the portion of state expenditures directed toward work-
"ers, we begin by classifying them into three major groups. The first group"
"consists  of  items such as labor  training  and  services, housing  and com-"
"munity services, income support, social security, and welfare (except  for"
"the  small  items called  military  disability  and  military  retirement,  which"
we treat  as a cost of war). These services are assumed to be received en-
tirely  by  workers  either  in  money  or  in  commodity  form.  The  second
"group includes such conventional categories as education, health and hos-"
"pitals, recreational and cultural activities, energy, natural resources, trans-"
"portation, and postal services; these are treated as social consumption in"
"general,  and  the workers' share in them  is estimated  by multiplying the"
group total  by the share of  total  labor  income in personal  income. The
"last  group  comprises  two  kinds  of  expenditures,  (a)  Central  executive,"
"legislative and judicial activities, international affairs,  space, national de-"
"fense,  civilian safety,  veteran benefits,  and agriculture; these are the ex-"
"penses of reproducing and maintaining the system itself, what Marx calls"
"the faux  frais  of  capitalist  society  (Marx  1977, p.  446).  (b)  Economic"
