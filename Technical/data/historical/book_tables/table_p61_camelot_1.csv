3.1.1  National  accounts  with production  sectors  alone
Consider production  alone.  Suppose that the total product con-
"sists of  2000 hours of  (labor) value,  whose aggregate selling price is any"
"money  sum,  say  4000  ""currency  units"" (CU).  The  total  labor  value  of"
2000 hours is expressed in 4000 CU of money. But we can always redefine
"the  unit  of  money  to  be  equal  to  2 CUs,  name this new  unit  a ""dollar,"""
and say that the total selling price of 2000 hours of value is 2000. While
"this is merely a notational device, it simplifies our exposition by allowing"
one  magnitude  (with  differing  units)  to  represent  total  labor  value  and
"also  its  monetary  expression,  the total  selling  price  of  the product.  The"
"term ""value"" will therefore be used for both labor value and its monetary"
"expression,  unless we wish to explicitly distinguish them."
"Once  we  introduce  trading  activities,  we  need  to  distinguish  between"
the  producer's  price  (the  price  at  which  the  product  is  sold  by the pro-
"ducer to the wholesaler/retailer), and the final selling price charged by the"
wholesaler/retailer (which includes their markup). As long as the markup
"is positive,  there will be a transfer  of  value from the producing sector to"
the trading sector. This was discussed in Section 2.4.
None  of  the  results  we  derive  depend  significantly  on  whether  or  not
producer  prices  or final selling  prices  of  individual  commodities  deviate
"from their corresponding labor values. Regardless of any such deviations,"
"the sum of individual producer prices defines an aggregate producer price,"
and  the  sum  of  individual  final  selling  prices  defines  an  aggregate final
selling  price of  the total  product; this is all we need to  know  at present.
The issue  of  individual  price-value  deviations  and their impact  is taken
up in Sections 4.1 and 5.10.
"Throughout this chapter, we will assume that the 2000 selling price of"
"the total  product  is composed  of  400 in production  costs,  200 in pro-"
"duction worker wages, and 1400 in profits (profit-type income) and other"
"expenses.  In  order  to  track  the  use  of  this  same  aggregate  product,  we"
will  assume  that  production  costs  represent  the  costs  of  inputs  used  in
