"years  in  which  we  have  input-output  tables,  and  interpolated  to  create"
annual  series  for  each  variable.  This  is  accomplished  in  the  following
manner.
"(a)  In  each  input-output  year,  we  calculate  the  ratio  of  the  com-"
ponent  to  either  its  using  or  its  receiving  industry's  gross  value
added.  For material  inputs  M' (and depreciation  D later on) we
"utilize the using industry's GVA. Thus for MJ, we create the ratio"
"xp s  (Mp/GVAp)IO, where the subscript IO refers to the fact that"
both variables are from input-output tables. For royalties RY we
"use the receiving industry's GVA (i.e. GVAry) as the numeraire, as"
in Xi =  (RYi/GVAry)Io.  This is done because some royalties such
as RYj and RYx_im appear as components of highly unstable final-
demand totals like I or X â€” IM (see Figure 5.1). Benchmark  coeffi-
cients created by dividing these royalties by unstable totals are not
very useful.  The same reasoning applies to rest-of-world  (ROW)
"entries in Figure 5.1, which are divided by total ROW in order to"
"form  coefficients  for extrapolation,  as in xr0Wg =  ROWg/ROW."
(b)  All coefficients  created as described in (a) are linearly interpolated
between benchmark  (IO) years. The result is an annual series for
"each coefficient,  derived entirely from input-output  data."
(c)  The  annual  observation  for  each  coefficient  is multiplied  by the
NIPA measure of the relevant gross value added (or ROW in the
case  of  rest-of-world  coefficients)  so  as to  create  a  NIPA-based
estimate of  the original  IO variable.  Thus
