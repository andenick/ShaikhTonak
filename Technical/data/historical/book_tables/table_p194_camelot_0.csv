"happen  in  our  own  double-entry  IO-based  methodology).  Nonetheless,",,
one  can  make  the  necessary  connections  between  his  partial  approach,,
and our more general one.,,
,Let  us  begin  with  a summary  of  our  own  mapping  between  Marxian,
,categories and those in national income accounts. Leaving aside questions,
,concerning the exact coverage of the trade sector (we include building rent-,
,"als in the trade sector,  whereas Mage implicitly treats all rents as ground",
,"rent),  we begin  from total value as the sum of  production  and trade sec-",
,tor IO gross outputs (TV = GOpt a  GOp + GOtt). Constant capital is de-,
,fined  as  the  sum  of  depreciation  and  materials  used  in  the  productive,
,sectors  (C s  Mp + Dp).  From this we derive Marxian value added as the,
,difference  between  total  value  and  constant  capital  (VA = TV —C  =,
,"GOpt — MJ,-D p),  which can also be expressed as the sum of  NIPA value",
,"added in the trade and production sectors (VApt = VAp + VAtt), royalties",
,(ground  rent  and  finance  charges)  in  the  production  and  trade  sectors,
,"(RYpt =  RYp  + RYtt), and intermediate inputs in the trading sectors (Mtt).",
,"Of  this  amount,  we  would  count  the  wages  of  production  workers  as",
,variable capital (V = Wp). Aggregate surplus value is therefore the rest of,
,"value added  (S = VA — V),  and this can also be written as the sum of",
,"indirect  taxes  (IBTpt),  profits  (Ppt),  and  royalties  (RYpt)  in  the  produc-",
,"tion and trade sectors, plus trade-sector intermediate inputs (Mtt). Table",
,"6.4,  which is adapted  from  Table 3.12, summarizes these relations.  Note",
,that  the subscript  pt  refers  to  the sum of  the production  and total trade,
sectors.,,
,"Mage  proceeds  in  exactly  the  opposite  direction,  building  up  certain",
,totals  from  the  individual  components.  Variable  capital  is defined  in es-,
,"sentially  the  same  way as ours,  as the ""wage received  by the  productive",
,"laborers"" in the production  and trade sectors  (Mage  1963, pp.  164, 188).",
,"However,  he restricts the definition  of  surplus value to only the ""total  of",
,"property incomes in the forms of profit,  interest and rent"" of the produc-",
,"tion and trade sectors (pp. 79,164).31 The lineage of this narrow conception",
,of  surplus  value  can be traced back  to  Gillman  and the Labor  Research,
,"Association.  Gillman  treats  ""property-income""  as  a  portion  of  surplus",
,"value,  the Labor  Research Association  treats it as the only relevant por-",
