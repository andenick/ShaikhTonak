transfer  of  value depends  solely on the difference  in export  and  import,,
,price-value deviations and on the level of trade: T = (dx -  dim) • X. Con-,
,"versely, if the price-value deviations are the same for exports and imports",
,(dx = djm = d)  then  the  net  transfer  depends  solely  on  the  level of  this,
,average deviation and on the balance of trade: T = d-(X -IM). If we,
,estimate d at  12 (see Section 5.10) then T is quite small relative to S,
and can safely be neglected.,,
,"In summary, the production  accounts within any one country will re-",
,"cord only domestically realized values. To correct for this, it is necessary",
,"to adjust  surplus value on the revenue side, and the recorded trade bal-",
,"ance X — IM on the use side, by subtracting the amount of the net trans-",
,fer of value T. This replaces realized surplus value and the realized trade,
,balance X -  IM with produced  surplus value and  the produced  trade,
,balance Xv -  IMv. The resultant measures of total value and total product,
will then reflect domestic production alone.,,
3.5  Noncapitalist  activities and illegal  activities,,
,"In principle, noncapitalist activities should be distinguished  from",
,capitalist ones. But in the official accounts of an advanced capitalist econ-,
,"omy such as the United States, such activities are either merged into the",
,"corresponding capitalist sectors (e.g., self-employed mechanics are treated",
,as unincorporated  enterprises  within the automobile repair industry) or,
,they are left  out  altogether  (most  notably  in the case of  the  household,
,"sector). We are unable to transcend these limitations in the data, although",
,we do provide estimates of the impact of unpaid household activities. As,
,"we saw in Chapter 1, unofficial  extended accounts do address such issues.",
,The one case in which noncapitalist activities are explicitly treated is a,
,dummy industry designed to capture the output of paid household labor,
,"such as that of ""maids, chauffeurs,  and baby sitters"" (BEA 1980, p. 28).",
,"As in the case of the government industry sector, the household industry",
,"dummy sector has only one entry in each row and column, in each case",
,representing the estimated wages of the workers involved. Even assuming,
,"that  such  labor  is mostly production  labor,  it is generally  not  capitalist",
,production  labor.18 The cost of this labor power therefore  cannot be in-,
,"cluded  in variable  capital.  The household  industry  sector,  like the gov-",
,"ernment  industry  sector,  must  be excluded  from  our  measures  of  total",
,"value  and  total  capitalistic  product.  Both  are  unproductive  of  capital,",
