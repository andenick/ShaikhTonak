These redefinitions always attempt to yield more homogeneous industries.
A.2.2  Secondary products
The basic statistical unit of the economic census is the establish-
"ment,  generally, characterized by a unique location, in contrast to a com-"
"pany,  which is based  on the legal  criterion of  ownership.  The establish-"
ment is assigned to the industry corresponding to its primary production.
"However,  the establishment  may have several other types of  production,"
which  are  referred  to  as  secondary  products.  It  is  in  the  interest  of  IO
analysis regarding technology to achieve the greatest possible homogeneity
"for the definitions of production processes, thus ensuring the greatest sta-"
"bility possible  for the technical  coefficients.  For this reason, national ac-"
countants try to reclassify the secondary products in order to obtain more
homogeneous  production  processes.  This  reclassification  of  secondary
products can be dealt with in three different  ways: (1) constant-commodity
technology;  (2)  constant-industry  technology;  and  (3)  separation  of  the
"input-output  table into two tables, Use and Make."
The first case  applies  when the technology  used  for  production  of  the
secondary  product  is  clearly  different  from  the  technology  used  to  pro-
"duce the primary product.  In this case, the activity resulting in the secon-"
dary product is simply redefined  as belonging to another industry on the
assumption  of  constant-commodity  technology; this treatment was used
"in all  six tables.  Alternatively,  the secondary  product  may  be the  object"
of a fictitious sale -  from the industry actually producing it to the one for
which this product  would  be the primary product.  This transfer  method
"was used in the 1947,1958,1963, and 1967 tables in order to deal with the"
^classifications made under the assumption of constant-industry technol-
ogy.  This  method  has  the  defect  of  artificially  increasing  the  share  of
"intermediary products in overall production,  with no corresponding jus-"
"tification  on  technological  grounds.  The  third  method,  which  was  used"
"for the tables of 1972 and 1977, corrects this problem by describing indus-"
"tries  and  commodities  separately.  This  method,  which  was  inspired  by"
"the  Von  Neumann  model,  requires  the  separation  of  the  input-output"
