Numerical example
Value side
C = A-(Mp)p = 2-200 = 400
VA =  H p=1600
V = A • (CONWp)p = 2 • 100 = 200
S = V A -V  = 1600-200 = 1400
TV = C + V + S = 2000
Use side
U = A.(Mp)p = 400
= 2 • (100 -I- 25 +100 + 575) = 1600
NP = V = 200
SP = F P - NP  = 1600-200 = 1400
TP = U + NP + SP = 2000
"Because there is only one productive sector, the calculated A = 2 hr/"
should represent the ratio of the labor value of the total product TV to its
producer  price  GOP (the input-output  gross  product  of  the  productive
"sector).  This  is clearly  the  case,  because  by construction  TV = 2000 hr"
and GOP = 1000. Applying the formulas  in Table 4.1 to the numbers in
"Figure 4.2, we correctly recover the labor value flows (in hours of abstract"
socially  necessary  labor  time)  which underly the money flows depicted.
