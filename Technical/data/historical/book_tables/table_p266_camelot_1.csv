justment  for the government final-demand sectors.
The  imputations  of  force  account  construction  (FAC)  for  the  federal
"and  state  final-demand  columns  did  not  affect  the inner  79 x 79 matrix,"
but  rather the final demand  and value added.  The imputations  involved
for  the  federal  and state final demand  were assumed to  derive  predomi-
"nantly from the compensation of government employees, and were there-"
fore  taken  from  the  government-industry  sector.  The  reasoning  behind
this is that the majority of this imputation is from wage payments to gov-
"ernment employees.  Therefore,  the difference  between the total compen-"
sation  of  general  government  as listed in NIPA  and that listed in the IO
tables  corresponds  to  the  imputations.  These  amounts  were then trans-
ferred from the construction to the government-industry row for the fed-
eral  and  state  final-demand  columns.  In order to  have the  construction
"row  and  column  total  match,  the  same  amount  was  removed  from  the"
value-added element of construction (11th column) and placed in the value
added  of  government  industry  (column  82).  There  is  a  certain  portion
"of  the total  imputations  that  does  not  correspond  to  compensation,  but"
"since this amount  seems to be rather small,  there was no point in adopt-"
"ing an unclear, ad hoc procedure to transfer it (see BEA 1980, pp. 46-7)."
In order to  scale up the FAC vector  for  1972 to reflect  changes in out-
"put, the following  formula  was used:3"
"3  The BEA has the actual imputations,  but we were not able to obtain them."
