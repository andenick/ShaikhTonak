,(2)  The  private  nonagricultural  sector  includes  unproductive  sectors
,"such as trade, finance, and real estate. Hence we need to adjust total hours"
,"for this, in order to better approximate hours per productive worker hp."
We calculate as  follows:,
,"(Hp)t  =  (hp)t â€¢ (Lp)t = total ""production"" worker hours in trade;"
"(Hp)fire =  (hp)fire-(Lp)fire = total ""production"" worker hours in finance,",
,"insurance, and real estate;"
