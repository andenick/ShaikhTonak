the two. The relations between the two types of calculation were discussed,
in Section 4.1. It was shown there that if the two sets of calculations are,
"to be consistent, in the sense that all money magnitudes would be propor-",
tional to the corresponding labor value magnitudes when purchaser prices,
"were  proportional  to  labor  values,  then  the  two  modes  of  calculation",
must be asymmetric.,
"To be more specific, we showed in Section 4.1 that because all commod-",
"ity bundles in actual input-output  tables are valued  at producer prices,",
calculations of unit labor values will actually yield labor-value/producer-,
"price ratios A*. Following the procedure developed in Shaikh (1975), these",
may be calculated as,
A* = hp*+A*app*,
