"of (correct) labor value measures (i.e., SP//NP/ = 700/100 = SP/NP =",
"1600/200), but this is solely because our numbers embody the convenient",
assumption that the percentage trading margins are the same for all bun-,
"dles of commodities. In actual IO tables this is definitely not the case, so",
that  the ratios of  money magnitudes could be biased in either  direction,
"depending on the relative trading markups. For example, the inconsistent",
estimate of the necessary product NP' is lower than the true estimate by,
the amount  of  the trading  margin  on productive workers' consumption,
"goods,  whereas the inconsistent  estimate of  the surplus product  SP' is",
lower  by the amount  of  the average trading  margin  on the mix of  con-,
"sumer, investment, net export, and government purchases in the surplus",
product.  Since consumer  goods pass through  both  wholesale and  retail,
"channels, they tend to have higher overall margins than goods purchased",
"for  investment or government  (Khanjian  1989, pp. 109-13). Leaving out",
trading margins therefore  imparts a relatively greater downward bias to,
"the necessary product than to the surplus product. Thus, an inconsistent",
procedure  in  which  the  calculations  of  the  money  forms  is made sym-,
metric with that of the value forms will tend to yield money rates of sur-,
"plus value that  are higher than  the corresponding  value rates, all other",

,The false  symmetry described  here is not  merely hypothetical. As we
"shall  see in Section  6.2.3, the only other  attempt  to provide a complete",
mapping between input-output  accounts and Marxian categories comes,
,"from Wolff (1977a,b, 1987), and it suffers from precisely this defect: Wolff"
"treats  money  and  labor  value  calculations  symmetrically,  which  makes",
"the former inconsistent with the latter. Indeed, as expected on theoretical",
"grounds, Wolff's estimates of money rates of surplus value are uniformly",
"higher  than  his  labor  value  estimates  by  about  4-8  (Wolff  1977b,",
"p.  103, table 3, 11. 1, 3). On the other  hand,  Khanjian's  (1989) estimates",
"are consistent, and they indicate that SVV is uniformly lower than  S/V",
"by about 6-8  (Khanjian  1988, p. 109, table 19). This allows us to es-",
timate  that  an  inconsistent  procedure  biases the  money rate  of  surplus,
value S/V upward by 12-15 (the sum of the two sets of  differences,
in years common to both Khanjian and Wolff).  Our discussion of the ac-,
tual empirical techniques is located in Sections 5.10 and 6.2.3.,
