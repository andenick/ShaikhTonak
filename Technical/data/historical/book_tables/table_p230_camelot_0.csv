"duction and nonproduction activities. Moreover, within each type of labor,",
he  distinguished  sharply  between  noncapitalist  and  capitalist  activities.,
It  is only  capitalist  production  labor  which  is  surplus-value-producing,

"7.1  Surplus value,  profit,  and growth",
,The classical  economists  recognized  that  the portion  of  the net
product  which is plowed  back  into production  is crucial in determining,
the  rate of  growth  of  the system.  It  follows  that  the division  of  the net,
product  between  consumption  and  investment  is of  the  utmost  impor-,
tance. Once one recognizes that  some labor activities are really forms of,
"social consumption,  it becomes evident that  not all increases in employ-",

rise to an increased demand  for  inputs to be used alongside of it and an,
increased  demand  for  consumption  goods to  be consumed  by it.  How-,

"creased  total  product,  which  recovers  not  only  a portion  equivalent  to",
the  increased  demand  for  materials  and  wage goods  but  also  a  surplus,

such  effect.,
,Malthus saw in this a saving grace. On the assumption that capitalism
"suffered  from a chronic lack of demand, the fact that nonproduction em-",
ployment  generated  demand  without  generating  supply implied  that  an,
