indicators of price-value deviations only if the mapping involved is con-,

simply because the calculation  procedure is inconsistent.,
,It  is easy to  see how an inconsistent  procedure  might  evolve. As indi-
"cated  in  Tables  4.1 and  4.2,  only  the  producer-price  components  enter",
"into the value calculations, whereas both the producer price and the trad-",

it  is  NP = CONWp = (CONWp)p + (CONWp)t.  If  one  has  not  derived,

"do,  then  it is tempting to make the price form  symmetric with the value",
