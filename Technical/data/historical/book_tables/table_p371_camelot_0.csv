Mage's  category  of professional  services is meant  to represent  noncapitalist  professional
"services, which is why he only deducts it in his estimates of the unincorporated sector (Mage"
"1963, p. 183). We estimate this as the sum of the unincorporated income of medical and legal"
"services -  table 6.14 (BEA  1976): line 17 plus line 18 equals $6,556 million."

a  The entries under the NIPA-IO  measure of GDP are quite straightforward  except for net
"interest and the absence of net rent. For nonfinancial  sectors, net interest is only actual net"
"interest paid minus net interest paid to the financial  sector. For nonrental  sectors, net rents"
paid  are treated  as part of the costs of operation  (intermediate  inputs)  rather  than  value
added; see Section B.I for further details.
"b  Mage (1963, pp. 270-1,  table  D-III).  Indirect business taxes and employee  compensation"
appear directly in this table. The elements in columns b-e in Mage's table add up to the re-
"maining five elements listed under Mage's gross product above. ""Other gross surplus value"""
in column b of Mage's table D-III  represents gross surplus value minus corporate  officers'
"salaries (which appear under employee  compensation),  which can also be expressed as the"
"sum of: corporate profits net of profits  taxes; profit of unincorporated  enterprises,  defined"
as their total income minus the wage equivalent for proprietors and partners; total (corporate
and  noncorporate)  net interest  paid; total  net rents paid net of real estate taxes; and total
"capital consumption allowances (Mage 1963, pp. 180-8). When we add to this the elements"
"in column c (wage equivalent), d (corporate tax liability), and e (real estate taxes), we obtain"
the last five elements listed in Table M.2.
"noted in Table M.2, the NIPA category of net interest in nonfinancial sec-"
tors is actual total net interest paid minus net interest paid to the financial
sectors  (the  latter  being  treated  as  imputed  interest  received).  One  can
"therefore  recover  total  net  interest  paid,  as  Mage  (1963,  pp.  182-4)  did"
