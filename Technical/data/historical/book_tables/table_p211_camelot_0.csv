,The  first  calculation  of  the  labor  value  rate  of  surplus  value  comes,
,in Okishio's  (1959) pathbreaking  study  for  Japan  in  1951. Also  available,
,"in  English  are  subsequent  studies  by  Izumi  (1980,  1983) and  by  Okishio",
,"and  Nakatani  (1985).  As  noted  in  the  beginning  of  this  chapter,  these",
,estimates  are  part  of  a  long  tradition  in  Japan  which  began  as  early  as,
1924.,,
,"Okishio  is the first not  only to  utilize input-output  tables,  but  also  to",
,"distinguish  between  productive  and  unproductive  labor  (1959, pp.  1-4).",
,"His calculations are similar to those we would use, with two notable excep-",
"tions. First of all, he treats all services as unproductive, although this may",,
,"simply  be  due  to  the  fact  that  his  input-output  data  combine  banking,",
,"real estate, and  services into one sector  (pp. 4, 6). More importantly,  his",
,treatment  of  unproductive  activities  inflates  the  measure  of  productive,
,"workers' consumption,  which  in turn  reduces  his estimate  of  the rate of",
,surplus value. Okishio begins by dividing his estimate of an average work-,
,er's daily consumption  bundle into the commodities  (conwp)p purchased,
,"from  productive sectors, and the unproductive expenditures (conwp)u com-",
,"prised of trade margins, rental and royalty payments, and expenditures on",
,services. The correct procedure at this point would have been to multiply,
,the former  by A* to obtain the unit value of labor  power n = V/(V + S) =,
,"A*'(conwp)p, the unit  surplus value (1 — n);  and the rate of  surplus  value",
,e = (1 — n)/n  = S/V.  But  Okishio  argues  that  -  because  a portion  of  the,
