Preface,xvii
,"From the mid- to late  1970s onward,  the various stages of  this project"
have regularly appeared  in Shaikh's lectures on advanced  political  econ-,
omy.  Many graduate students who have been (willingly and unwillingly),
exposed  to  this  material  over the years have provided  both  support  and,
criticism which has helped shape the final result.,
,"In addition to those mentioned previously,  we note our debts to Peter"
"Brooks,  Etelberto Ortiz,  Hector Figueroa,  Rebecca Kalmans, and Nezih",
"Giiner. Korkut Boratav, Nail Sathgan, and Sungur Savran provided criti-",
"cal feedback on a version of the manuscript, as did an anonymous referee",
"for this press. Hakan Arslan, Matt Noyes, and Greg Bongen were vital to",
the production of the many charts which adorn this book.  We also thank,
Russell Miller for his contribution to the construction of the index. Matt,
Darnell provided superb editorial assistance in rendering the final product.,
,"Most  of  all,  we wish to express our gratitude to  our families  for their"
,support and forbearance during this long and difficult task. It is to Fadime
"and Ali,  and to Diana,  Kirsten and Lia, that we owe the greatest debt.",
