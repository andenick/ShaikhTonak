In spite of the complexity  and  sophistication  of the various ex-
"tended accounts surveyed here, it is important to note that they all share"
"26  Of the  six extended  accounts  surveyed,  only  Nordhaus  and  Tobin  attempt  to"
"address  this  issue  directly,  in the  form  of their  deduction  for ""regrettables  and"
"disamenities."" But this is a rather ad hoc treatment,  and as Eisner (1988, p.  1627,"
"n.  15) points out, it crosses over the line between the measurement  of production"
(creation of objects of utility) and utility or disutility  itself.
"27  Unlike Eisner, Repetto et al. (1989, pp. 23-4) would not count the monetary reval-"
uation (the change in the monetary value of a given physical stock) in the measure
of  income and  product.
