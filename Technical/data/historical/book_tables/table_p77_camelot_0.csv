To  obtain  an  insight  into  the  profit-enhancing  effect  of  transfers  of
"value,  it  is  useful  to  consider  the  simple  case of  household  royalty  pay-"
ments in conjunction with the production sector alone. With production
"alone  and  no  household  royalty  payments,  aggregate  profit  is  equal  to"
aggregate surplus value (1400 as in Section 3.1.1). According to our con-
"vention,  this  aggregate  profit  is  also  the  income  of  the  capitalist  class."
Suppose that the capitalists in turn pay 450 of this personal revenue over
to the royalties sector as net interest and ground rent. The royalties sector
"will  then  have  a total  business  revenue  of  450,  split  into  (say)  300 in"
costs  and  100 in  profits.  Aggregate  business  profits  will  now  equal  the
profits  of  the  production  sector  (1400)  plus  the  profits  of  the  royalties
