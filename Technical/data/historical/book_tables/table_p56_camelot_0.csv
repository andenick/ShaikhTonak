,Similar results can be derived for transfers between capitalist and petty
"commodity  spheres.  For example,  suppose  a petty commodity  producer",
sells a product for $50 to a merchant who then sells it on the open market,
for  $250 (handicrafts  are an obvious example). For simplicity of  exposi-,
"tion, assume that the final selling price is merely the money equivalent of",
"the commodity's  (labor)  value.19 Then,  from  a global  point  of  view,  the",
merchant  has  merely  succeeded  in  transferring  four-fifths,($200/$250)
"of  the  total  value  of  the  product  to  himself,","leaving  only  one-fifth 
in"
the  hands  of  the original  producers.  But whereas a portion  of  the value,
transferred  in  to  the  merchant  will  show  up  as  part  of  aggregate  capi-,

ing transfer  out listed in the petty commodity  sector because its product,
will  be  valued  only  at  its  immediate  selling  price  (producer's  price)  of,
"$50,  rather than its final selling price (purchaser's price) of  $250. A por-",
tion  of  the transfer  in of  value  will therefore  show  up as a net  addition,
to aggregate  profit.,
,"Finally,  consider  transfers  within  the  capitalist  sector  itself,  between"
the circuit  of  capital  and the circuit  of  revenue.  Suppose an  (uninsured),
"object such as a television set is stolen from a house, sold to an unscrupu-",
"lous  merchant  for  $50,  and  then  resold  on  the  open  market  for  $250.",
"From the point  of  view of  the society as a whole,  the original owner has",
"lost an asset worth $250, a new owner has gained an asset worth $250 but",
"has given up a money sum of exactly the same amount, and the merchant",
and  thief  have  shared  out  a  net  gain  of  $250.  The  merchant's  profit  is,
then clearly the counterpart of a portion of the original owner's loss. But,
"if  we disregard this latter loss,  or record it only at partial value, then of",
course  the  merchant's  profit  will  seem to  spring  out  of  thin  air.  Section,
3.2.2 provides a particularly striking example of this  effect.,
,"The  preceding  examples  should  make  it  clear  that,  even  at  the  most"
,"abstract level,  aggregate profit  encompasses  both profit  on surplus value"
"and profit on alienation. At a more concrete level, we must also allow for",
some profit on alienation derived from various transfers between national,
,capitals and other  foreign capitals and noncapitals.  The issue here is not
