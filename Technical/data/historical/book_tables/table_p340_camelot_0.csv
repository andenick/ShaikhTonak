Unit wage of production workers in government enterprises
does just that. We calculate variable capital as the product of  production
"worker wages wp, the ratio x of employee compensation to wages and sal-"
"aries, and the number Lp of production workers. In this calculation, cor-"
porate officers' salaries play an insignificant  role -  only through their very
"slight effect on the compensation/wage ratio x. In effect, the slightly higher"
compensation/salary  ratio  x'  of  corporate  officers  is  weighted  by  their
very small  share in total  wages and salaries  (4.2% in manufacturing  for
"1968;  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service,  Statistics  of  Income),  so  that  the"
ratio x is virtually unaffected  when we deduct corporate officers' compen-
"sation  and  salaries  from  the  numerator  and  denominator,  respectively"
(the difference  is 0.7%  in manufacturing  for  1968). Thus our estimate of
"V*, and hence of SVV*, is essentially the same as if we had first deducted"
corporate officers' salaries from employee compensation and from wages
and salaries.
"However,  the same is not  true  for  our total  measure of  wages  W, be-"
"cause  this  directly  contains  corporate  officers'  salaries.  Therefore,  our"
measure of  unproductive wages Wu = W-   V* is larger by the amount  of
COS. As long as we recognize that Wu is the sum of unproductive worker
"wages and corporate salaries, this poses no serious problem."
The use of  EC as our base also requires that we estimate the unit em-
ployee  compensation  of  production  workers  ecp  by  enhancing  the  BLS
data on their unit wage by an estimate of  the ratio x (of  employee com-
pensation EC to wages and salaries WS) for production workers in each
"sector.  For this  ratio  x,  we use the  ratio of  EC to  WS of  all  workers  in"
