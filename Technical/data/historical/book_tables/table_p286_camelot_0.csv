"In the case of  household  royalty payments,  a reverse effect  operates.",
"Since households are the ones paying the royalties, the payments them-",
selves do not  appear  as business costs and hence do not reduce the con-,
ventional measures of production  and trade value added (whose total in,
this case equals the Marxian measure VA*). But the receipt of these pay-,
"ments is still recorded as the gross output  GOry of the royalties sector, a",
portion  VAry of  which  enters into  the  royalties-sector  value added  and,
hence into aggregate value added VA. The net effect of household royalty,
payments is to increase the conventional measure of aggregate value added,
"relative to its Marxian  counterpart,  other  things being equal. A similar",
"effect will be found for household payments to the government, to the ex-",
tent  that  the government  in turn transfers  some of this revenue back to,
"the royalties sector (through net interest payments, etc.). Thus, we cannot",
,"say a priori which of the two measures will be larger.  Indeed, the empiri-"
"cal  evidence indicates  that  VA exceeds  VA*, so that  the  effect  just  dis-",
"cussed is apparently strong enough to predominate. Table B.2, based on",
"Figure B.14, illustrates this new type of pattern.",
The (direct or government-mediated)  reflux of household income into,
the royalties sector has the further  effect  of raising aggregate profits rela-,
tive to  surplus  value.  The  reasons  are the  same  as before:  Because the,
"household payments are not business costs, they do not reduce the aggre-",
"gate profits of the production and trade sectors; however, a part of their",
receipt by the royalties sector shows up as its profits. The net effect  is to,
"raise aggregate profits, other things being equal.",
