"Shaikh  (1987, 1992b). Finally, it is worth  noting that  the relative stabil-",
ity of  the proportion  between productive and total trade sectors in Fig-,
ure  5.5  does  not  carry  over  to  the  proportion  between  productive  and,
"unproductive labor in Figure 5.9, which rises dramatically over the post-",
war period.,
"5.3  Employment,  wages, and variable capital",
,The transition  from  input-output  tables to  a NIPA-based  data
set allows us to take advantage of the employment and wage data avail-,
able  in  NIPA  and  in  related  sources  such  as the  Bureau  of  Labor  Sta-,
tistics (BLS). Our primary database for  employment  and wages is  from,
"NIPA. For total employment  L we use ""persons engaged in production""",
"(PEP),  since  this  includes  both  employees  and  self-employed  persons;",
"for  wages we use ""employee compensation"" (EC), which includes wages",
and salaries of employees as well as employer contributions to social se-,
curity. Employee compensation  is the appropriate  measure upon which,
"to base our estimates of variable capital, since it represents the total cost",
of labor power to the capitalist.,
NIPA data make no distinction between production and nonproduction,
"workers,  unlike  BLS data.6  We therefore  use the latter  to  calculate the",
ratios of production labor to total labor in each production sector. These,
ratios are then  applied  to relevant  NIPA employment  totals in order  to,
split them into comparable components. A combination of BLS and NIPA,
"data  is also used  to  estimate the wage per production  worker,  which is",
then applied to the previous estimate of the number of productive workers,
to  derive the total  wage bill  of  productive  labor  (variable capital). The,
wage bill  of  unproductive  workers  is derived  as the difference  between,
total  NIPA wages and our estimate of total variable capital. These pro-,
cedures allow us to retain NIPA estimates of total employment and total,
wages  -  which  are  tied  to  the  value-added  and final-demand estimates,
used to create our primary measures - while still making use of important,
information  available  only  from  the BLS. The basic steps involved  are,
outlined next.,
