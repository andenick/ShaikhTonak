Our  empirical  analysis  of  the  U.S.  economy  will  be  set  out  in  several
sections. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 will utilize suitably modified  input-output
tables to develop benchmark  year estimates of Marxian measures of the
"total, intermediate, and final product,  and then use NIPA data to inter-"
polate between benchmark  estimates to create an annual series for each
of these measures. Sections 5.3 and  5.4 develop the estimates of annual
"employment, wages, variable capital V, surplus value S, surplus prod-"
"uct  SP, and the rate of  surplus value SVV, and compare them to the"
more conventional  measures such as profit-type  income and the  profit/
"wage ratio.  Section  5.5  measures  the  Marxian  rate  of  profit,  and  com-"
pares it with the average observed rate (net of those parts of surplus value
which are absorbed into nonproduction  expenses) and the observed cor-
porate rate. Section 5.6 measures the rate of exploitation of unproductive
"workers, and compares it to that  of  productive labor; Section 5.7 com-"
pares Marxian  and  conventional  measures of  productivity.  Sections  5.8
"and  5.9  examine  the  impact  of  the  state  on  accumulation,  through  its"
absorption of surplus value and through the effects of taxes and social ex-
penditures on the rate of surplus value. Section 5.10 examines the effects
"of  price-value  deviations  on  aggregate Marxian  measures,  and  Section"
5.11 develops a technique that allows us to approximate the rate of surplus
