three sample years)  of  the size and direction  of  the net transfer  between,
"workers and the state (i.e., of the balance between taxes paid by workers",
and the social expenditures directed toward them). This paper circulated,
"widely,  but  was  never  published  (although  an  extended  and  somewhat",
"different  version  appeared  in  Shaikh  1980b).  Instead,  Shaikh  turned  his",
attention  to  broadening  the  framework  to  encompass  input-output  ac-,
counts and data.,
,"In the late  1970s,  Ahmet  Tonak  also  became interested  in the estima-"
tion  of  Marxian  categories.  Using  the  schema  of  Shaikh's  unpublished,
"paper, he produced one of the first systematic estimates of the rate of sur-",

"mates  of  the net tax on  workers to the whole postwar period,  providing",
"his own  estimates  of  variable  capital  and  surplus value,  and tracing  out",
the general impact of  the net tax on the rate of  surplus value. This work,
"became his Ph.D. dissertation in 1984, which was the basis for subsequent",
extensions by Tonak  (1987) and Shaikh and Tonak (1987).,
,"During the early 1980s, our attempts to utilize input-output  data were"
greatly hampered  by a lack  of  computer  facilities.  Many people were in-,
strumental in helping to overcome these and other related barriers. Michel,
"Juillard,  who  was  at  the  time  working  on  recasting  U.S.",input-output
"and national  income account  data into a Marxian departmental  schema,",
was  of  invaluable  theoretical  and  empirical  help.  So  too  was  Katherine,
"Kazanas,  whose  work  focused  on  the  impact  of  the  distinction  between",
production  and nonproduction  labor  for the measurement  of  productiv-,
ity. Julie Graham and Don Shakow provided similarly crucial support in,
the manipulation  of  the input-output  tables. Ernest Mandel and Dimitri,
Papadimitriou  helped secure funding  at various points. With the help of,
"Eduardo  Ochoa,  Paul  Cooney,  and  Michel  Juillard,  Ara  Khanjian cre-",

and compare money and labor value flows in the United States (Khanjian,
1989). All provided great moral and intellectual  support  throughout.,
,"By the mid-1980s, the two of us had begun working together on turning"
"this  project  into  the  present  book.  A  first  draft  was  produced  in  1985,",
thanks to a grant provided through the generous support of the Hamburg,
"Institute  for  Social  Studies,  and the basic results were made available in",
"the same year at a conference supported by Bard College. A second, sub-",

mitriou  of  Bard College  and  Bernard  Rodgers  of  Simon's  Rock  College,
,of  Bard provided  moral  and material  assistance  for  our efforts.  We owe
them a special debt.,
