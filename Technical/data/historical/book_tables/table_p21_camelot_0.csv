1.1  Approaches to the measurement  of  national  product
This book aims to provide an alternate foundation  for the mea-
surement of the production of nations. The framework  developed here is
applied  to the U.S. economy  for  the postwar  period. The patterns that
result  are significantly  different  from  those derived within  conventional
systems of national accounts.
"National accounts give systematic empirical form to the structure, pat-"
"terns,  and  performance  of  an  economy  (Young  and  Tice  1985). In the"
"modern world, they provide the objective basis for judging the level and"
progress of the wealth of nations and for identifying the causes of success
and  failure.
Conventional systems of national accounts include the United Nations
"System  of  National  Accounts,  the  United  States  National  Income and"
"Product Accounts, and various forms of input-output accounts. It is our"
contention  that  these types  of  accounts  seriously  distort  the  levels and
"trends  of  the  national  product,  the  surplus  product,  productivity,  and"
other  major  aggregate  economic  variables.  Because  measurement  and
"analysis are inextricably intertwined, our understanding of intertemporal"
and international economic development is correspondingly  affected.
Criticisms of official national accounts are not new. Debates about their
"purpose  and  structure  have  gone  on  from  the  very  start  (Eisner 1988,"
"p.  1611). In  recent  times,  there  has  been  a  renewed flurry of  questions"
"about  their  adequacy.  Such criticisms come from  a variety of  quarters,"
ranging from  official  agencies such as the United Nations to a variety of
prestigious economists. In Section 2 we address the issues involved.
The measurement of national product lies at the core of all systems of
"national accounts (Carson and Honsa 1990, pp. 28-9). In this regard, it is"
