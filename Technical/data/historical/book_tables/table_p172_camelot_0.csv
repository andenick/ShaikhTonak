Critical  analysis  of previous  empirical  studies,153
"value as early as 1924, Terashima makes industry-level ones by 1935, Shah",
"Riff  develops  aggregate  estimates  by  1940, and Okishio  pioneers the use",
"of  input-output  tables to  make labor value estimates by 1959. All in all,",
Izumi lists 56 sets of  estimates of the rate of  surplus value in Japan from,
"1924 to  1980 (Izumi  n.d.).  In our own survey, we will analyze studies by",
"Okishio (1959), Izumi (1980,1983), and Okishio and Nakatani (1985), be-",
cause these four  have been translated into (or published in) English.,
,The studies we cover will be grouped according to the manner in which
they  treat  the  distinction  between  production  and  nonproduction  activ-,
ities.  There  are three  basic  categories  of  studies:  those  which  implicitly,
or explicitly  reject  the  distinction  between  productive  and  unproductive,
"labor,  so  that  they  end  up  treating  Marxian  categories  as  equivalent  to",
NIPA  categories; those  which  do  base themselves  on  Marx's  distinction,
"between  productive  and  unproductive  labor,  but  differ  in  the  way  they",
implement  this  distinction;  and those  which  substitute  some  sort  of  dis-,
tinction  between necessary  and unnecessary  activities  for  the  distinction,
"between  production  and nonproduction,  thereby substituting  some con-",
"cept  such as Baran and Sweezy's notion  of  ""surplus"" (the excess of  total",
"product  over necessary  social  use)  for  Marx's concept  of  ""capitalist sur-",
"plus product"" (the excess of total capitalist product over the consumption",
"of the productive workers). Within each category, we will also distinguish",
"between  sectoral  and  aggregate  studies,  because  systematic  transfers  of",
value make the former less reliable than the latter.2 Aggregate studies will,
also be distinguished  according to whether or not they make labor value,
estimates of  Marxian categories.,
,The distinction  between  money  and labor value measures gives rise to
,a  further  consideration.  We have  seen that  the  distinction  between pro-
ductive  and  unproductive  labor  implies  that  the money  form  of  surplus,
"value  will  generally  differ  in  magnitude  from  aggregate  profit,  even  if",
"(final selling) prices were proportional to values. On the other hand, even",
"if  all  labor  were  productive  labor,  the  deviations  of  prices  from  values",
,could make the money measure of surplus value differ from the labor value
