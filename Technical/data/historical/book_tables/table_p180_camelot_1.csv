excess of gross value added over wage costs (however defined). Although
"these two errors have offsetting  effects  on his data, they render his post-"
war estimates useless.12 They also invalidate his analysis of the long-term
10  Sharpe  also  calculates  two  alternative  measures  of  the rate of  surplus value.  As
"part  of  his input-output  estimate  (Sharpe  1982b), he calculates  a ""narrowly de-"
"fined""  measure of the rate of  surplus value which is based on the assumption that"
surplus  value  is the  same thing  as property-type  income.  This  gives  an  estimate
"of  29 in  1976,  as compared  to  109.1  for  his  main  measure  and  to  188 for"
Cuneo's estimate  of  the rate of  surplus value in Canadian manufacturing.  In an
"unpublished  paper,  Sharpe  (1982a,  pp. 41-5)  calculates  a NIPA-based  constant-"
dollar estimate which is similar in form to the main estimates of his input-output
"study.  This  has  a  similar  trend  to  his  labor  value  estimates,  but  an  even  lower"
level.
11  Varga actually calculates surplus value as the difference between the money value
"of  the  total  product  and  the  sum  of  materials,  depreciation,  and  wage  costs  of"
production.  But the difference  between the first item and the sum of the next two
"is simply  value  added,  so his measure of  surplus value is net value added  minus"
production wages.
"12  For  instance,  the census figures for  manufacturing  in  1947 (U.S.  Bureau  of  the"
"Census 1975, series P6-10, p. 666) list gross value added GVA =  74,291, production"
