SP =  (CONCP + Ip) + (Mt + CONWt + CONCt + It)
=  (200 + 200) + (200 + 400 + 200 + 200) = 1400.
Figures 3.4 and 3.5 depict these new divisions of  value and use value.
The last  step is to  assemble all the preceding information  into a map-
"ping  between  input-output  and  Marxian  accounts.  To  accomplish  this,"
we need to delve further into the conventions of  IO tables.
We begin by noting that whereas commodities are sold to their final users
"at purchasers' prices,  most  input-output  tables are cast in terms of  pro-"
ducers' prices. Thus the total  revenue listed  for  any given activity  (gross
"output  and gross product,  in IO terminology)  is its estimated  producer's"
"price, not its actual s^les revenue (purchaser's price). By the same token,"
"the total revenue of the trading sector (its ""producers' price"") is the sum of"
the trading margins on all activities that pass through this sector.6 But such
a procedure immediately creates a problem in the valuation of  purchases
"of inputs and of elements of final demand, since these items are acquired at"
purchasers' prices. Conventional IO tables get around this by treating any
"single commodity purchase as two separate but simultaneous transactions,"
one from the producing sector in an amount equal to the producer's price
"of  the commodity  input,  and one  from  the trading  sector  in an  amount"
equal to the trading margin on the same bundle of commodities. In this way
