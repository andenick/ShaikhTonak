2.1.4  Personal  and social  consumption
"We have emphasized that production, distribution,  maintenance"
"of  the social  order,  and personal  consumption  are all part and parcel  of"
the  process  of  social  reproduction.  The  distinctions  between  them  have
nothing to do with one being intrinsically more necessary than the others.12
Each  type  of  activity  uses  up  use  values  as  material  inputs  in  order  to
arrive at its own distinctive  outcomes.  But only the first activity  directly
results in the creation of  new wealth and hence in a net product over and
"above  what it uses up.  The other three  facilitate,  respectively,  the  social"
"transfer  of  this  new  wealth,  the  maintenance  and  reproduction  of  the"
"social  conditions  of  existence,  and the maintenance and reproduction  of"
individuals in the society.13
"Of  the  three  nonproduction  activities,  the first two  (distribution  and"
"social  maintenance)  involve  the  performance  of  labor,  while  the  third"
"(personal  consumption)  does  not.14  Nonetheless,  they  have  in  common"
the  property  that  they  all  use  up  use  values  in  their  performance  with-
"out  themselves  directly resulting in the creation of  new wealth. As such,"
they  must  necessarily  be  supported  by  existing  physical  or  nonphysical
"wealth.  They are, in other words, similar to personal consumption  itself"
in that their net effect  is to consume  a portion  of  the net social  product:
"nonproduction 
labor  is a form  of  social  consumption.  This  is  precisely"
why  classical  economists  insisted  on  distinguishing  between  production
"(""productive"") labor and nonproduction (""unproductive"") labor. See Fig-"
ure 2.2.
"important,  precisely  because  capitalist  production  tends  to  confine 
individual"
workers to distinct activities.
12  The  fact  that  social  reproduction  requires  all  four  activities  in one  form  or an-
"other  need not  prevent us from  arguing that  one existing  form  is wasteful,  dan-"
"gerous,  etc.  Thus  one  could  argue,  as  many  radicals  do,  that  some  production"
"activities  (nuclear  weapons),  some  distribution  activities  (false  and  misleading"
advertising)  and some  social  maintenance  activities  (subsidies to corporate agri-
business)  are  undesirable.  This  superimposes  the  distinction  between  desirable
"and  undesirable  upon  the  four  analytical  categories  we  have  defined,  thereby"
adding another dimension to the analysis.
"13  To  say  that  the  latter  three  ""indirectly"" result  in  production  is only  to  say that"
"they are necessary  for  social reproduction.  Thus, consumption indirectly results"
"in production  because  it reproduces the producers themselves.  Conversely,  pro-"
duction  indirectly  results  in  consumption  insofar  as  it  produces  the  articles  of
present consumption  or the means of  future  consumption.  The concept  of  indi-
rect production therefore tells us nothing new.
14  Household  labor  should  not  be  confused  with  consumption  activity.  Activities
such as cooking and cleaning are production labor. Consumption activity is quite
