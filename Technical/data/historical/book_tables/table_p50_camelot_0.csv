,Figure 2.3.  Productive and unproductive labor under capital.
,The identification of that labor which produces surplus value -  in other
"words, that labor which is productive  of  capital -  immediately  allows us",
to specify  its two salient properties:,
,"(a)  it is wage labor which is first exchanged against capital (i.e., it is"
,capitalistically  employed);
(b),"it is labor which creates or transforms  use values  (i.e.,  it is pro-"
,duction labor).
,"The definition  derived  here is identical  to the one Marx (1977, p.  644)"
,uses  to  characterize  productive  labor.  All  other  labor  is thereby  unpro-
,"ductive  of  capital,  either  because  it  is  production  labor  that  produces"
,"direct  use  values  or  commodities  but  not  capital,  or  because  it  is  non-"
,production labor. Thus even capitalistically employed wage labor can be
,unproductive  of  capital  if  it  is  distribution  or  social  maintenance  labor
,"(Marx  1977, p.  1042). It is surprising how often  this basic point has been"
misunderstood  in the literature.15,
,The fact that all labor other than capitalistically employed  production
,labor is unproductive of capital does not in any way negate the specificity
,of  the individual components  of this labor. Petty commodity  production
,"and household labors have very different effects on capitalist reproduction,"
,"even though  they both  produce  use values.  For instance,  suppose  that  -"
,at a particular  stage in economic  development  -  half  of  the standard  of
,living of the working class is supported out of the use values produced by
,"(unpaid)  household  labor,  and the other half  by commodities  purchased"
,with the wages of  employed  workers.  If over time the directly  produced
,use values  were gradually  replaced  by the products  of  petty  commodity
,"production, then in order to maintain the same standard of living the pur-"
,"chasing  power  of  workers  would  have  to  rise to  double  its  initial  level,"
,other things being equal. Thus a given standard of living could correspond
,15  See Gough (1972). Even Hunt's careful tracing of Marx's argument stumbles over
,"this issue (Hunt  1979, pp. 313-15)."
