,Mage  complements  his  money  value  measures  of  Marxian  categories
with a corresponding  set of  labor value measures. The basic procedure is,
"quite straightforward.  By definition, Marxian labor value added is simply",
the number of hours worked by productive workers (Hp). If we can some-,
"how  estimate the labor value of  productive labor power (V)  (i.e.,  of  the",
"goods consumed by productive workers), then we can immediately calcu-",
late surplus value as S = Hp -  V. One could then judge how well the labor,
value measures correspond to the (apparently independent) money value,
measures.,
,Since  Hp  is readily computed  from  the data already used to make the
"money value estimates (Mage 1963, pp. 210-11), the only remaining prob-",
lem  is the estimate  of  V.  And  it is here that  Mage  adopts  an  apparently,
simple  and  appealing  procedure.  Since  he already  has  a measure  of  the,
"money  value  of  variable  capital  (V),  he  converts  it  into  a  labor  value",
measure  ( V)  through  the  estimated  labor  value  of  one  dollar  (A).  By,
"his definition,  V' = A-V, andS' = H p - V ' = H p - A  - V  (pp. 196-8). He",
then  presents  labor  value  measures  that  are  very  similar  to  his  earlier,
"money value measures (compare charts VI-1, VI-2, and table VI-1 on pp.",
"172-5 to charts VIM,  VII-2, and table VIM  on pp. 204-9).",
,The money value and labor value measures  appear to be largely inde-
"pendent of one another, so that their close correspondence seems to imply",
that price-value deviations are negligible. Although this might indeed be,
"the case,  Mage's technique provides no evidence for it at all. To see this,",
let us define the labor value of  one dollar as the ratio of the money value,
of  Marxian  value  added  to  the  hours  of  productive  labor  (which  is  the,
,labor  value  of  Marxian  value  added): A = VA/HP.  Then  it can be im-
"mediately shown that Mage's definitions  will yield a ""labor value"" rate of",
surplus value which is identical to the corresponding  money rate.  Recall,
"that Marxian value added VA = V + S, while hours of productive labor",
,Hp = V + S.  Suppose we now define the value of  money as A =  Hp/VA;
then we can multiply the expression for VA by A  to  obtain,
Hp = A-V+A-S,
,"It is clear that if we further define the ""value of labor power"" to be V'="
"A-V,  then  S' = H P-V'=A-S,  so  that  S/V =  SVV.  This is  simply",
an algebraic identity.  Mage seems aware of the tautological  nature of his,
