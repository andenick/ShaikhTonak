,"noncapitalist  sectors, then the total  surplus value realized in the production sec-"
,"tor as a whole will always be less than that produced in it, because of the portion"
,transferred  to  the  trade  sector.  Price-value  deviations  may  cause  further  inter-
,"sectoral  and  international  transfers,  which  can  in  principle  reverse  the  outflow"

,at  prices  that  are  not  proportional  to  values  (such  as  market  prices  and  prices
,"of  production),  and  the  money  form  of  surplus  value  at  prices proportional  to"
,"values (which we call ""direct prices"")."
