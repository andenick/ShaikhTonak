"However,  for  such a table there is no ideal solution  for the treatment  of",
"scrap and second-hand goods, even though the small amounts they repre-",
sent have little influence  on the final results.,
,If these second-hand products are treated as the other secondary prod-
ucts and so attributed to other industries in the proportion in which they,
"are produced, then they appear as input required by production, and thus",
any increase in the level of activity of an industry using scrap will generate,
an increase in the demand for scrap and second-hand goods for the input-,
"output model. On the other hand, because the business sector resells used",
"cars  to  households  and  buildings  to  the  government,  the  gross  private",
investment  in  the  fixed-capital  column  of  an  input-output  table  has  a,
negative amount for scrap and second-hand goods. The mechanical redis-,
tribution  of  this  negative  amount  among the industries  producing  scrap,
and second-hand goods results in the appearance of  negative amounts in,
"several cells of  the investment  column,  because those industries (such as",
steel) that  are relatively  large producers  of  scrap do not produce  invest-,
ment goods.  The advantage  of  treating  scrap and second-hand  goods as,
other  secondary  products  is that  it ensures that  the balance  of  accounts,
for  each  industry  will  be  maintained.  This  was the method  used  for  the,
"first five tables: 1947,1958,1963,1967,  and 1972.",
,"In order to avoid generating a demand for scrap and second-hand goods,"
"the  BEA  (1980) recommended  an alternative  method,  which takes scrap",
and second-hand  goods  out  of  the total  production  of  each  commodity.,
This  technique  has  the  disadvantage  of  destroying  the  equilibrium  be-,
"tween resources and uses for each industry,  and requires that an implicit",
adjustment  be  incorporated  into  value  added.  This  is  the  method  used,
,for 1977 in this study. It should be stressed again that the amount of scrap
and  second-hand  goods  is at most  a few  percentage  points  of  total pro-,
"duction,  and  that  the  problem  is  of  a more  conceptual  nature  and  less",
