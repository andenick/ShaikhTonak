payments.,
,Figure  3.8 depicts  the overall  effects  of  royalty  flows  on the mapping
between Marxian and IO categories. Some royalty payments (RYp + RYt),
made  by the primary  sectors  (production  and trade)  are listed  as costs,
and  hence  recorded  in the intermediate  inputs  of  these  sectors.  Others,
(RYp + RY/)  are shown  as disbursement  from  the value  added  in these,
"sectors.  Finally,  transfers  out of  household  income  and other  final ex-",
"penditures are listed as purchases (RYC, RY^ in the final demand column.",
,Table 3.7 provides the corresponding  algebraic summary.  Note that in
"light  of  the discussion  concerning  the effects  of  transfers  of  value,  no",
,"general pattern between VA and VA, or between S and P, has been pre-"
sumed  to  hold.  But the rate  of  surplus  value  SVV  is shown  as being,
,larger than the measure of the profit/wage  ratio because this general em-
pirical pattern is rooted in the fact that V < W.,
3.2.2  Profit-type,income  can exceed surplus  value
,We have seen that whereas royalty payments by primary sectors
,to  secondary  sectors  tend  to  reduce  the measure  of  profit-type  income
