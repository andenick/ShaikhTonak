onstrates  that  money  and  labor  value  calculations  are  completely  sym-
metric  when  all  labor  is  assumed  to  be  productive  (pp.  88-9).  He  then
"introduces  the  distinction  between  productive  and  unproductive  labor,"
being  careful  to  note that  unproductive  activities  can be quite  necessary
(p.  97). This leads him to divide the IO tables into productive and unpro-
"ductive sectors, with the trade sector counted among the latter (pp. 92-4)."
"On this basis,  he provides  new  procedures  for  the calculation  of  value/"
"price ratios and labor value magnitudes (pp. 95-6), which are the same as"
the ones we summarized previously.  But in the treatment of  money mea-
"sures, he mistakenly generalizes the previous symmetry between Marxian"
and IO categories to the situation when some labor is unproductive; this
leads him to calculate money magnitudes in an exactly symmetric manner
with  labor  value  magnitudes  (p.  95).57  His  money  measures  are  there-
"fore  inconsistent  and  incorrect.  Khanjian  (1988,  pp.  122-30)  illustrates"
the problem with a numerical  example based on Wolff's  procedures. We
showed  in Section  4.1 that  the money  rate of  surplus value estimated  in
"this  manner  will  typically  be larger  than the value  rate.  Indeed,  Wolff's"
estimates  of  S*/V*  are generally  higher  than those  of  S/V  by  4%-8%.
Given that the consistent  estimates made by Khanjian yield money rates
