Figure B.8.  Partial IO representation of business royalties payments as
disbursements from value added.
"acknowledged through the creation of a royalties column, with gross out-"
put GOry equal in magnitude to the sum of the royalty payments RYp and
"RYt. But now, because the payments themselves are recorded in the value-"
"added row of the productive and trade sectors, there is no corresponding"
"separate royalties row. Thus, whereas total gross output GO has been in-"
"flated by  GOry,  no  such  addition  has  been  made  to  total  gross  product"
"GP.  At  this point,  the tables would  not  balance.  Figure B.8  depicts this"
unhappy  situation.
"Within  the logic  of  orthodox  economics,  in which all  sectors are pro-"
"ductive, the simplest way out of this dilemma is to define all royalty pay-"
"ments made by businesses directly to the royalties sector as costs of ""prod-"
"ucts"" purchased  from  the  royalties  sector,  regardless  of  whether  or  not"
businesses treat them that way. Thus (say) net interest payments made by
nonfinancial businesses to the banking sector would be treated in the same
"way  as banking  service  charges.  In the  present  case,  this means  shifting"
RYp and  RYt  out  of  the  value-added  row  into  a newly  created  royalties
row. This is the end result of  the procedure followed  in mput-output  ac-
counts.8 The resulting table is identical to Figure B.7; Table B.I  provides
an algebraic summary of  the results.
