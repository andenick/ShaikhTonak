The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  develop  a  mapping  between  Marxian
categories  and  those  of  conventional  national  accounts.  The  essential
"points  of  the argument  will  be presented  here,  with all  further  detail re-"
served for Appendix  A.
National income and product accounts (NIPA) are the traditional base
for  national  accounting.  But  input-output  (IO)  tables  provide  a  more
general framework  in that they encompass both interindustrial flows and
national  income-product  flows.  We  will  therefore  use  IO tables  as  our
basic theoretical  and empirical  foils.
Although  IO accounts  provide  a superior description  of  the  economy
"for  our purposes,  they suffer  from the drawback  of  being available  only"
"for  benchmark  years  (1947,  1958,  1963,  1967,  1972,  1977)  for  the  United"
States.  We  will  therefore  use  these  tables  only  to  provide  comprehen-
"sive benchmark estimates, which will then be expanded into annual series"
using NIPA  data.
Our project requires distinguishing between three different sets of mea-
"sures, for which we adopt different notation: Marxian labor value measures"
"such  as  constant  capital,  variable  capital,  and  surplus  value  (C, V, S);"
"their money forms  (C*, V*, S*); and corresponding  IO-NIPA  aggregates"
"such  as  intermediate  inputs,  wages,  and  profit-type  (unearned)  income"
"(M, W, P).  Since all accounts  in question will be double-entry  accounts,"
"each of the revenue-side flows will have use-side counterparts (such, as U"
"for the Marxian labor value of the inputs used in production,  U*  for the"
"corresponding Marxian money value, and M for the orthodox measure of"
intermediate inputs on both revenue and use sides). The letter P taken by
"itself will refer to profit-type income, but when preceded by another letter"
or  when  appearing  as  a  subscript  it  will  refer  to  production.  Thus  TP
"stands for total product, and Pp refers to profits in the production sector."
