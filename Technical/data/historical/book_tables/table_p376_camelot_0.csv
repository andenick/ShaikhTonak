est  income  brackets.  We therefore  exclude  both  (a)  and  (b)  from  labor,
income and consumption.,
,Our point of departure on the tax side is total employee compensation.
This  is  the  total  cost  incurred  by  capitalists  for  the  purchase  of  labor,
power; it includes wages and also such benefits as employer contributions,
for  social  insurance  and  other  labor income.  Two  main groups  of  taxes,
flow out of this total. Employee compensation is the cost to capitalists of,
hiring  workers.  But the income  received by workers is less than this be-,
"cause a certain portion, labeled employee and employer contributions, is",
"deducted  for  social  security.1  Accordingly,  our first group  of  taxes con-",
sists of  the portion  of  employee compensation  which goes toward  social,
"security taxes; the second group consists of personal income taxes, motor",
"vehicle licenses, property taxes (primarily on homes), and other taxes and",
"nontaxes (a very small category which includes passport fees, fines, etc.).",
"Since these are levied on both earned and unearned incomes, the portion",
emanating  from  labor  is estimated  by  using  the  share  of  total  labor in-,
come in personal  income.,
,"To summarize, social welfare expenditures directed toward workers are"
"the  sum  of  all  government  expenditures  on  labor  training  and  services,",
"housing and community services, income support, social security and wel-",

"ilarly,  taxes  levied  directly  on  workers' compensation  include  all  social",
"security contributions as well as the bulk of personal income taxes, motor",
"vehicle  licenses,  property  taxes,  and  other taxes  and nontaxes.2  The  net",
transfer  is then the difference between social welfare expenditures directed,
toward  the  working  class  and  taxes  taken  out  of  the  flow  of  employee,
compensation.  Table N.I  illustrates  the calculations  for  1964. Table  N.2,
,"presents the whole series from  1952 to 1985, with rates calculated relative"
to total employee compensation EC.,
