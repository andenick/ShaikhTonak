"unproductive  labor actually declines relative to that of  productive labor,",
"by about  12%, over the postwar period (Table 5.6 and Figures  5.8-5.11).",
,The  Marxian measure of  productivity  q* is about  three times as large
"as the conventional  measure y, and also rises relative to it for  significant",
"periods. From 1972 to 1982, the ratio of the respective numerators of the",
"two  measures  (i.e.  TPVGDP)  rises,  in  good  part  because  the  oil-price",
rise raises the cost  of  the intermediate goods that appear in TP* but not,
"in GDP.  At  the same time,  the  ratio of  productive  employment  to  total",
"employment  falls  more  rapidly than  in the previous  decade.  Thus,  even",
though the growth rate of  q* slows down gradually over the whole post-,
"war  period,  that  of  y  shows  a  marked  change  in  pattern  in  the  critical",
"period 1972-82, which is then perceived as a pernicious and puzzling ""pro-",
"ductivity slowdown"" (Naples  1987, p.  122). It is interesting to note,  how-",
"ever, that the trend (but not the level) of the Marxian measure is very well",
"captured by the approximation y*, defined as Marxian real net final prod-",
uct per productive worker hour (Figures 5.19 and 5.20).,
,Both  surplus value  S* and profit-type  income  P  rise strongly  over the
"postwar period, but the former is much larger and rises somewhat  faster.",
On the other hand variable capital  V* (the productive worker wage bill),
is  much  smaller  and  rises  much  more  slowly  than  total  employee  com-,
pensation EC. Thus the true rate of  surplus value is not only almost  four,
"times as large as its naive counterpart,  the profit/wage  ratio P+/EC,  but",
"also moves very differently: the rate of surplus value rises by almost 50%,",
while the profit/wage  ratio actually falls by almost 27%. The latter gives,
"the impression of  a ""wage squeeze"" on profits; the former shows just the",
opposite.  This serves to emphasize  that even the most  inclusive  measure,
of  the  profit/wage  ratio  is  a  bad  proxy  of  the  rate  of  surplus  value.  A,
similar comment  applies for the relation between the Marxian flow mea-,
sure of  constant  to variable capital  and the conventional  IO measure  of,
"intermediate  input  to  employee  compensation  (Section  5.5,  Table  5.7,",
and Figures 5.12-5.15). The ratio of fixed constant capital to variable cap-,
,"ital rises by almost 90% over the postwar period, which more than offsets"
"the 50% rise in the rate of  surplus value. Consequently, the Marxian rate",
"of  profit  falls  by 24%. The  corporate  rate of  profit  falls  even  faster,  by",
"57%,  because a rising portion of  surplus value is absorbed in unproduc-",
tive expenses (so that the portion remaining for profit  declines relative to,
surplus value).,
,"The intervention  of  the state, via taxes and transfers,  requires that we"
"account  for  a different  kind  of  transfer  -  out  of  wages,  particularly  the",
wages of productive workers. The nominal wage is altered by (positive or,
,"negative transfers)  involving  net interest,  net ground rent,  and net taxes"
(net of  social benefit  expenditures received).  Insofar  as these impinge on,
