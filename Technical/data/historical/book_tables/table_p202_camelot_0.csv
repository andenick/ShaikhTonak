We  will  call  v'  the  unit  value  of  labor  power,"Similarly,  Aglietta's  real"
"social  wage cost  w'= wr/y,  where wr = the real wage rate per unit  labor",
"and y = productivity  per unit labor.  In Appendix  L,  we show that if  the",
"two measures use the same data on real wages and productivity,  then",
v'=(Ac/Ay)w',
where,
"Ac  = unit labor value of  (workers') consumption goods,  and",
Ay  = unit labor value of  net output.,
"Thus,  as  Aglietta  notes,  the  real  social  wage  index  w'  will  reflect  the",
"unit value index v' if Ac/Ay, the ratio of the unit labor values of  consumer",

Several things stand out in Figure 6.8.  One can see that our Aglietta-type,
