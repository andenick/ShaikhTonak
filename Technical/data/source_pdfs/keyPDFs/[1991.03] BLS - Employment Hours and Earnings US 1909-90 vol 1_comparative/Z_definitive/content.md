Preface
This bulletin presents, in two volumes, historical monthly and annual average
data on national establishment-based employment, hours, and earnings by de-
tailed industry, classified in accordance with the 1987 Standard Industrial Classi-
fication (SIC) Manual
This is the first issuance of historical data based on the 1987 sic structure. It
supplants Employment, Hours, and Earnings, United States, 1909-84 (BLS Bulle-
tin 1312-12) issued in 1985 and the Supplement to Employment and Earnings is-
sued in August 1989, both of which presented data based on the 1972 SIC.
The data are obtained from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program, a
Federal-State cooperative endeavor in which data are collected monthly from the
payroll records of a sample of nonfarm business establishments. In 1990, the sam-
ple included over 340,000 establishments employing over 40 million wage and
salary workers.
The conversion to the 1987 SIC structure was effective with the publication of
data for August 1990. Coincident with this conversion, all national estimates of
employment, hours, and earnings were adjusted to March 1989 benchmarks—
comprehensive counts of employment based primarily on unemployment insur-
ance reports filed by employers with State employment security agencies. As is the
usual practice with the introduction of new benchmarks, all seasonally adjusted
series were revised to incorporate updated seasonal adjustment factors. In addi-
tion, all published constant-dollar and indexed series were rebased from
1977=100 to 1982=100.
All data from April 1988 forward reflect both the March 1989 benchmark ad-
justments and the effects of the SIC revision. Historical (pre-1988) data for indus-
try series affected by the SIC revision have been reconstructed where possible. His-
torical data for the industry series unaffected by the SIC revision remain as
previously published. All rebased constant-dollar and indexed series have been
recomputed back to the date of inception.
In accordance with the usual practice, all published seasonally adjusted series
have been revised for the most recent 5 years (1985-90). In addition, series affected
by the SIC revision which were reconstructed for years prior to 1985 have again
been seasonally adjusted, based on the 1987 sic-based estimates. Also, seasonally
adjusted average weekly hours and manufacturing overtime hours series have
been recomputed from January 1980 forward to incorporate a new moving-holi-
day adjustment introduced in May 1990 with the publication of April-July 1990
seasonal adjustment factors.
Most of the data presented in this bulletin are supplemented on a current basis by
the monthly publication Employment and Earnings, available by subscription from
the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,
DC 20402. In addition, published series in the form of magnetic tapes and personal
computer diskettes are available to interested data users on a cost-for-
service basis. Inquiries should be addressed to the Division of Monthly Industry
Employment Statistics, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, DC 20212.
This bulletin was prepared under the direction of Patricia M. Getz, a super-
visory economist in the Division of Monthly Industry Employment Statistics,
George S. Werking, Chief. Data verification was directed by Mary Lee Seifert, a
supervisory economist in the same division. Data were processed under the direc-
tion of Brendan J. Powers, Chief, Division of Federal/State Monthly Surveys.
Editorial assistance was provided by Gloria Peterson Green, Chief, Data Users
and Publication Services Group.
