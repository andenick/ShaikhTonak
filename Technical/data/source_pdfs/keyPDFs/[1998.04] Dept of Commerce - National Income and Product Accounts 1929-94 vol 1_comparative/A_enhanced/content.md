Preface 
In this two-volume publication, the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis presents the revised estimates of the national 
income and product accounts (NIPA's) for 1929-94 that 
reflect the most recent comprehensive and annual revi-
sions of the NIPA's.1 The results of the comprehensive 
revision, including revised estimates of fixed reproducible 
tangible wealth, were released from January 1996 to May 
1997, and the results of the 1997 annual revision were 
released in July 1997. 
The 1996 comprehensive revision was the 10th of 
its kind since the Department of Commerce first pub-
lished national income statistics in 1942. Comprehensive, 
or benchmark, revisions differ from annual NIPA revi-
sions because of the scope of the changes and because 
of the number of years that are subject to revision. 
1. For specific information about these revisions, see the SURVEY OF 
CURRENT BUSINESS articles listed in the box "Information About NIPA 
Methodology." 
Comprehensive revisions incorporate three major types 
of improvements: (1) Definitional and classificational 
changes that update the accounts to more accurately por-
tray the evolving U.S. economy, (2) statistical changes 
that update the accounts to reflect the introduction of new 
and improved methodologies and the incorporation of 
newly available and revised source data, and (3) presen-
tational changes that update the NIPA tables to reflect the 
definitional, classificational, and statistical changes and 
to make the tables more informative. 
The first section of this publication describes the def-
initions and classifications underlying the NIPA's. The 
second section discusses the presentation of the NIPA's, 
and the third section discusses the statistical conventions 
used for the NIPA estimates. An appendix lists the princi-
pal source data and methods used to prepare the estimates 
of gross domestic product.
