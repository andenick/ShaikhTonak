    "text": "Preface In this two-volume publication, the Bureau of Economic Analysis presents the revised estimates of the national income and product accounts (NIPA's) for 1929-94 that reflect the most recent comprehensive and annual revi- sions of the NIPA's.1 The results of the comprehensive revision, including revised estimates of fixed reproducible tangible wealth, were released from January 1996 to May 1997, and the results of the 1997 annual revision were released in July 1997. The 1996 comprehensive revision was the 10th of its kind since the Department of Commerce first pub- lished national income statistics in 1942. Comprehensive, or benchmark, revisions differ from annual NIPA revi- sions because of the scope of the changes and because of the number of years that are subject to revision. 1. For specific information about these revisions, see the SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS articles listed in the box \"Information About NIPA Methodology.\" Comprehensive revisions incorporate three major types of improvements: (1) Definitional and classificational changes that update the accounts to more accurately por- tray the evolving U.S. economy, (2) statistical changes that update the accounts to reflect the introduction of new and improved methodologies and the incorporation of newly available and revised source data, and (3) presen- tational changes that update the NIPA tables to reflect the definitional, classificational, and statistical changes and to make the tables more informative. The first section of this publication describes the def- initions and classifications underlying the NIPA's. The second section discusses the presentation of the NIPA's, and the third section discusses the statistical conventions used for the NIPA estimates. An appendix lists the princi- pal source data and methods used to prepare the estimates of gross domestic product.

    "text": "Definitions and Classifications Underlying the NIPA's NIPA entries The major components of the NIPA's are presented and defined below within the context of the Summary Na- tional Income and Product Accounts (see table A on page M~4). The five summary accounts show the composition of production and the distribution of the incomes earned in production. In these accounts, production consists of the goods, services, and structures that are produced in the current period. Production, or \"current production,\" and its related incomes do not include gains or losses from the sale of nonproduced assets, such as land, or of financial assets, such as stocks and bonds. In addition, production does not include gains or losses from holding goods in inventories. The first summary account is the National Income and Product Account: The right side shows gross domestic product (GDP) as measured by the sum of the goods and services produced in the United States and sold to final users, and the left side shows GDP as measured by the incomes earned in production (gross domestic income) and the \"statistical discrepancy\" between the two meas- ures. Each of the components in this summary account can be mapped to one of the other summary accounts and can, in turn, be mapped to one or more of the 142 tables that make up the fiill set of NIPA tables. This system of integrated, double-entry accounts provides a compre- hensive and unduplicated measure of economic activity within a consistently defined framework.2 Thus, the NIPA's—together with the industry, wealth, and regional accounts—can be used to trace the principal economic flows among the major sectors of the economy. Within the summary accounts, each entry has a coun- terentry, generally in another account. The parenthetical numbers that follow an entry in table A identify the coun- terentry by account and line number. Except for the major income and product aggregates, the entries are usu- 2. For more information on the concepts underlying the accounts, see Al- lan H. Young and Helen Stone Tice, An Introduction to National Economic Accounting, Methodology Paper No. 1 (1985); and Carol S. Carson, GNP: An Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods, Methodology Paper No. 4 (1987). For information on the availability of these papers, see the box \"Information About NIPA Methodology.\" ally defined in the sequence in which they appear in the five-account summary. The definition of a component is not repeated for the counterentry, but a cross-reference is made to the first appearance of the definition. After the components in the five-account-summary are defined, the following other definitions are presented: Final sales of domestic prod- uct, gross domestic purchases, final sales to domestic purchasers, population, personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income, gross saving as a per- centage of gross national product, U.S. residents, foreign residents, and the rest of the world. Major aggregates Gross domestic product (GDP), the featured measure of U.S. output, is the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States. Because the labor and property are located in the United States, the suppliers (that is, the workers and, for property, the owners) may be either U.S. residents or residents of the rest of the world. Gross domestic income (GDI) (1—34) measures output as the costs incurred and the incomes earned in the pro- duction of GDP. In theory, GDP should equal GDI, but in practice, they differ because their components are es- timated using largely independent and less-than-perfect source data. This difference is termed the \"statistical discrepancy\" (see page M—8). Gross national product (GNP) is the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property supplied by U.S. residents. Because the la- bor and property are supplied by U.S. residents (see page M-10), they may be located either in the United States or abroad. The difference between GDP and GNP is net receipts of factor income from the rest of the world. These net receipts represent income from the goods and services produced abroad using the labor and property supplied by U.S. residents less payments to the rest of the world for the goods and services produced in the United States using the labor and prop- erty supplied by foreign residents.

Gross national income (GNI) (1—31) is the costs in- curred and the incomes earned in the production of GNP. GNI is the sum of (1) factor incomes—compensation of employees, proprietors' income, rental income of persons, corporate profits, and net interest; (2) three aonfactor charges—business transfer payments, indirect business taxes, and the current surplus of government enterprises less government subsidy payments; and (3) consumption of fixed capital (CFC), which is the fixed capital \"used up\" in the production process during the accounting period. GNI and GNP also differ by the statistical discrepancy. Net domestic product (NDP) is the net market value of the goods and services attributable to labor and property located in the United States and is equal to GDP less CFC. Net national product (NNP) is the net market value of goods and services attributable to the labor and property supplied by U.S. residents and is equal to GNP less CFC. The measure of CFC used for both NDP and NNP re- lates only to fixed capital located in the United States. Investment in the capital is measured by private fixed investment and government gross investment. National income (1—20) is the sum of the factor in- comes. It is a net factor-cost measure (net of CFC) equal to the income that originates in the production of goods and services from labor and property supplied by U.S. residents. Domestic income, also a net factor-cost measure, is the income that originates in the production of goods and services attributable to labor and property located in the United States. Personal income is the income received by persons from all sources—that is, from participation in pro- duction, from both government and business transfer Information About NIPA Methodology As part of each comprehensive and annual revision of the NIPA's, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes a summary de- scription of the principal source data and methods used to prepare the current-dollar and real estimates of gross domestic product. The most recent \"Updated Summaiy NIPA Methodologies\" was pub- lished in the September 1997 issue of the SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS and is reprinted as an appendix in this publication. BEA has also prepared a series of papers that discuss the con- cepts that underlie the NIPA's and that present detailed descriptions of the methodologies used to prepare the estimates.1 However, the methodologies that are described in these papers are subject to periodic improvements, usually as part of the annual and compre- hensive revisions. These improvements—which consist of changes in definitions and in source data, the incorporation of new source data, and the use of new estimating methods—are described in ar- ticles in the SURVEY. For example, two major improvements were the shift to gross domestic product as the featured measure of U.S. production and the introduction of a new treatment of government investment.2 Copies of the following methodology papers are available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). • An Introduction to National Economic Accounting, Method- ology Paper No. 1 (1985)—NTIS accession No. PB85-247567, $12.50 • Corporate Profits: Profits Before Tax, Profits Tax Liability, and Dividends, Methodology Paper No. 2 (1985)—NTIS accession No. PB85-245397, $27.00 1.

    "text": "payments, and from government interest (which is treated like a transfer payment). \"Persons\" consists of individu- als, nonprofit institutions that primarily serve individuals, private noninsured welfare funds, and private trust funds. Personal income is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' in- come with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital con- sumption adjustment,personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, less personal contributions for social insurance. Disposable personal income is personal income less personal tax and nontax payments. It is the income available to persons for spending or saving. National Income and Product Account GDP is measured as the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment (includ- ing change in business inventories and before deduction of charges for CFC), net exports of goods and serv- ices (exports less imports), and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. GDP excludes intermediate purchases of goods and services by business. Personal consumption expenditures (1—36) is goods and services purchased by persons resident in the United States. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) con- sists mainly of purchases of new goods and of services by individuals from business. In addition, PCE includes purchases of new goods and of services by nonprofit institutions (including compensation of employees), net purchases of used goods by individuals and nonprofit in- stitutions, and purchases abroad of goods and services by U.S. residents.3 PCE also includes purchases for certain goods and services provided by government agencies— primarily tuition payments for higher education, charges for medical care, and charges for water and sanitary serv- ices. Finally, PCE includes imputed purchases that keep PCE invariant to changes in the way that certain activ- ities are carried out—for example, whether housing is rented or owned, whether financial services are explicitly charged, or whether employees are paid in cash or in kind. The following conventions are used to classify each PCE commodity: Durable goods (1—37) are commodities that can be stored or inventoried and that have an average life of at least 3 years; nondurable goods (1—38) are all other commodities that can be stored or inventoried; and services (1—39) are commodities that cannot be stored and that are consumed at the place and time of purchase. 3. Purchases of fixed assets, including residential structures by individuals and by nonprofit institutions that primarily serve individuals, are classified as gross private domestic investment. Gross private domestic investment (1-40) consists of fixed investment (1—41) and change in business in- ventories (1—46). Fixed investment consists of both nonresidential (1—42) fixed investment and residential (1-45) fixed investment. It consists of purchases of fixed assets, which are commodities that will be used in a production process for more than 1 year, including re- placements and additions to the capital stock, and it is measured before a deduction for consumption of fixed capital. It covers all investment by private businesses and by nonprofit institutions in the United States, regardless of whether the investment is owned by U.S. residents. (Purchases of the same types of equipment and struc- tures by government agencies are included in government gross investment.) It excludes investment by U.S. resi- dents in other countries. Nonresidential fixed investment consists of both structures (1—43) and producers' durable equipment (PDE) (1-A4). Nonresidential structures consists of new construction, brokers' commissions on sales of structures, and net purchases of used structures by private business and by nonprofit institutions from government agencies. New construction also includes hotels and motels and mining exploration, shafts, and wells. Nonresidential PDE consists of private business pur- chases on capital account of new machinery, equipment such as furniture, and vehicles (except for personal-use portions of equipment purchased for both business and personal use, which are included in PCE), dealers' mar- gins on sales of used equipment, and net purchases of used equipment from government agencies, from persons, and from the rest of the world. Residential fixed investment consists of private struc- tures and of residential PDE—equipment owned by landlords and rented to tenants. Investment in structures consists of new units, improvements to existing units, mobile homes, brokers' commissions on the sale of res- idential property, and net purchases of used structures from government agencies. Change in business inventories (1—46) is the change in the physical volume of goods purchased by private business for use in the production of other commodities or for resale, valued in average prices of the period. It differs from the change in the book value of inventories reported by most business; the difference is the inventory valuation adjustment (described on page M—7). Net exports of goods and services (1—47) is ex- ports (1-48) less imports (1-49) of goods and services. Receipts and payments of factor income and transfer payments to the rest of the world (net) are excluded. Government consumption expenditures and gross in- vestment (1—50) consists of net purchases of goods, Digitized for FRASER http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis",

Of this total, gross investment is net purchases of new and used structures and equipment by general government and government enterprises; all other transactions are consumption expenditures. Government consumption expenditures and gross investment excludes purchases by government enterprises (except for fixed assets), trans- fer payments, interest paid or received by government, subsidies, and transactions in financial assets and in nonproduced assets, such as land. Compensation of employees (1—1) is the income accru- ing to employees as remuneration for their work. It is the sum of wage and salary accruals and of supplements to wages and salaries. Wage and salary accruals (1—2) consists of the mon- etary remuneration of employees, including the com- pensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; voluntary employee contributions to certain de- ferred compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans; and receipts in kind that represent income. Wage and salary accruals consists of disbursements (1—3) and wage accru- als less disbursements (1—4). Disbursements is wages and salaries as just defined except that retroactive wage pay- ments are recorded when paid rather than when earned. Accruals less disbursements is the difference between wages earned, or accrued, and wages paid, or disbursed. In the NIPA's, wages accrued is the appropriate meas- ure for national income, and wages disbursed is the appropriate measure for personal income. Supplements to wages and salaries (1—5) consists of employer contributions for social insurance and other labor income. Employer contributions for social in- surance (1-6) consists of employer payments under the following Federal and State and local government programs: Old-age, survivors, and disability insur- ance (social security); hospital insurance; unemployment insurance; railroad retirement; government employee retirement; pension benefit guaranty; veterans life in- surance; publicly administered workers' compensation; military medical insurance; and temporary disability insurance. Other labor income (1—7) consists of em- ployer payments (including payments in kind) to private pension and profit-sharing plans, private group health and life insurance plans, privately administered workers' compensation plans, supplemental unemployment benefit plans, corporate directors' fees, and several minor cate- gories of employee compensation, including judicial fees to jurors and witnesses, compensation of prison inmates, and marriage fees to justices of the peace. Proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments (1—8) is the current- production income (including income in kind) of sole proprietorships and partnerships and of tax-exempt co- operatives. The imputed net rental income of owner- occupants of farm dwellings is included; the imputed net rental income of owner-occupants of nonfarm dwellings is included in rental income of persons (described below). Proprietors' income excludes dividends and monetary interest received by nonfinancial business and rental in- comes received by persons not primarily engaged in the real estate business; these incomes are included in dividends, net interest, and rental income of per- sons. (See \"inventory valuation adjustment\" and \"capital consumption adjustment.\") Rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment (1—9) is the net current-production income of persons from the rental of real property except for the income of persons primarily engaged in the real estate business; the imputed net rental income of owner-occupants of nonfarm dwellings; and the royal- ties received by persons from patents, copyrights, and rights to natural resources. (See \"capital consumption adjustment.\") Corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments (1—10) is the net current- production income of organizations treated as corpora- tions in the NIPA's. These organizations consist of all entities required to file Federal corporate tax returns, including mutual financial institutions and cooperatives subject to Federal income tax; private noninsured pension funds; nonprofit institutions that primarily serve business; Federal Reserve banks; and federally sponsored credit agencies. With several differences, this income is meas- ured as receipts less expenses as defined in Federal tax law. Among these differences: Receipts exclude capital gains and dividends received, expenses exclude depletion and capital losses and losses resulting from bad debts, inventory withdrawals are valued at replacement cost, and depreciation is on a consistent accounting basis and is valued at replacement cost using depreciation profiles based on empirical evidence on used-asset prices that generally suggest a geometric pattern of price declines.

    "text": "in the United States by the rest of the world. (See \"in- ventory valuation adjustment\" and \"capital consumption adjustment.\") Profits before tax (1—12) is the income of organizations treated as corporations in the NIPA's except that it reflects the inventory- and depreciation-accounting practices used for Federal income tax returns. It consists of profits tax liability, dividends, and undistributed corporate profits. Profits tax liability (1-13) is the sum of Federal, State, and local income taxes on all income subject to taxes; this income includes capital gains and other income excluded from profits before tax. The taxes are measured on an accrual basis, net of applicable tax credits. Profits after tax (1-14) is profits before tax less profits tax liability. It consists of dividends and undistributed corporate profits. Dividends (1-15) is payments in cash or other assets, excluding the corporations' own stock, that are made by corporations located in the United States and abroad to stockholders who are U.S. residents. The payments are measured net of dividends received by U.S. corporations. Dividends paid to State and local govern- ment social insurance funds and general government are included. Undistributedprofits (1-16) is corporate profits after tax less dividends. Inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) (1—17) for cor- porations is the difference between the cost of inventory withdrawals as valued in the source data used to deter- mine profits before tax and the cost of withdrawals valued at replacement cost. It is needed because inventories as reported in the source data are often charged to cost of sales (that is, withdrawn) at their acquisition (historical) cost rather than at their replacement cost (the concept un- derlying the NIPA's). As prices change, companies that value inventory withdrawals at acquisition cost may real- ize profits or losses. Inventory profits, a capital-gains-like element in profits, result from an increase in inventory prices, and inventory losses, a capital-loss-like element in profits, result from a decrease in inventory prices. In the NIPA's, inventory profits or losses are shown as adjust- ments to business income (corporate profits and nonfarm proprietors' income); they are shown as the IVA with the sign reversed. No adjustment is needed to farm propri- etors' income because farm inventories are measured on a current-market-cost basis. Net interest (1—19) is the interest paid by private busi- ness less the interest received by private business, plus the interest received from the rest of the world less the interest paid to the rest of the world. Interest payments on mortgage and home improvement loans and on home eq- uity loans are counted as interest paid by business because home ownership is treated as a business in the NIPA's. In addition to monetary interest, net interest includes imputed interest, which is paid by corporate financial business and is measured as the difference between the property income received on depositors' or policyholders' funds and the amount of property income paid out explic- itly. The imputed interest paid by life insurance carriers and noninsured pension plans attributes their investment income to persons in the period it is earned. The im- puted interest payments by financial intermediaries other than life insurance carriers and private noninsured pen- sion plans to persons, governments, and to the rest of the world have imputed service charges as counterentries in GDP and in net receipts of factor income from the rest of the world; they are included in personal consumption ex- penditures, in government consumption expenditures and gross investment, and in exports of goods and services, respectively. Business transfer payments (1—21) consists of pay- ments to persons (1—22) and to the rest ofthe world (1-23) by private business for which no current services are performed. Business transfer payments to persons con- sists primarily of liability payments for personal injury and of corporate gifts to nonprofit institutions. Business transfer payments to the rest of the world is nonresident taxes—taxes paid by domestic corporations to foreign governments. Indirect business tax and nontax liability (1—24) con- sists of (1) tax liabilities that are chargeable to business expense in the calculation of profit-type incomes and (2) certain other business liabilities to general government agencies that are treated like taxes. Indirect business taxes includes taxes on sales, property, and production. Em- ployer contributions for social insurance are not included. Taxes on corporate incomes are not included; these taxes cannot be calculated until profits are known, and in that sense, they are not a business expense. Nontaxes includes regulatory and inspection fees, special assessments, fines and forfeitures, rents and royalties, and donations. Non- taxes generally excludes business purchases from general government agencies of goods and services that are sim- ilar to those provided by the private sector. Government receipts from the sales of such products are netted against government consumption expenditures. Subsidies less current surplus of government enter- prises (1—25). Subsidies is the monetary grants paid by government agencies to private business and to govern- ment enterprises at another level of government. The current surplus of government enterprises is their cur- rent operating revenue and subsidies received from other levels of government less their current expenses.

Subsidies and current surplus are shown as a combined entry be- cause deficits incurred by some government enterprises may result from selling goods to business at below-market prices in lieu of giving them subsidies. Consumption of fixed capital (1-26) is a charge for the using up of private and government fixed capital located in the United States. It is based on studies of prices of used equipment and structures in resale markets. For general government and for nonprofit in- stitutions that primarily serve individuals, it is recorded in government consumption expenditures and in personal consumption expenditures, respectively, as the value of the current services of the fixed capital assets owned and used by these entities. Private capital consump- tion allowances consists of tax-return-based depreciation charges for corporations and nonfarm proprietorships and of historical-cost depreciation (calculated by BEA using a geometric pattern of price declines) for farm proprietor- ships, rental income of persons, and nonprofit institutions. Private capital consumption adjustment is the differ- ence between private capital consumption allowances and private consumption of fixed capital. Receipts of factor income from the rest of the world (1-32) consists of receipts by U.S. residents of interest and dividends, of reinvested earnings of foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations, and of compensation paid to U.S. residents by foreigners.

Wage and salary disbursements (see 1—3). Other labor income (see 1-7). Proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments (see 1—8). Rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment (see 1—9). Personal dividend income (2—11) is the dividend in- come of persons from all sources. It equals net dividends paid by corporations (see 1—15) less dividends received by government (2—13). Dividends received by govern- ment consists of dividends received by State and local governments, primarily by their retirement systems. Personal interest income (2—14) is the interest income (monetary and imputed) of persons from all sources. It equals net interest (see 1—19) plus net interest paid by government (2—16) plus interest paid by persons (2—17). The last item consists of all interest paid by individuals except mortgage interest, which is reflected in net rental income of persons. Transfer payments to persons is income payments to persons for which no current services are performed. It consists of business transfer payments to persons (see 1—22) and government transfer payments (2—20). Government transfer payments includes benefits from the following social insurance funds: Old-age, sur- vivors, and disability insurance (social security); hospital insurance; supplementary medical insurance; unem- ployment insurance; government employee retirement; railroad retirement; pension benefit guaranty; veterans life insurance; workers' compensation; military medical insurance; and temporary disability insurance. Gov- ernment transfer payments also includes benefits from certain other programs: Veterans benefits other than life insurance, food stamps, black lung, supplemental security income, public assistance (including medical care and family assistance), and educational assistance. Government payments to nonprofit institutions exclud- ing payments for work under research and development contracts are also included.

Population is the total population of the United States, including the Armed Forces overseas and the institution- alized population. The monthly estimate is the average of Census Bureau survey estimates for the first of the month and the first of the following month; the quarterly and annual estimates are the averages of the relevant monthly estimates. Personal saving as a percentage ofdisposable personal income (DPI), frequently referred to as \"the personal sav- ing rate,\" is calculated on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis as the ratio of personal saving to DPI. Gross saving as a percentage of gross national prod- uct (GNP), sometimes referred to as \"the national saving rate,\" is calculated on a quarterly and annual basis as the ratio of gross saving—the sum of gross private saving, gross government saving, and capital grants received by the United States (net)—to GNP. U.S. residents are individuals, governments, business enterprises, trusts, associations, and similar institutions that have the center of their economic interest in the United States and that reside or expect to reside in the United States for 1 year or more. (For example, busi- ness enterprises resident in the United States include U.S. affiliates of foreign companies.) In addition, U.S. res- idents include all U.S. citizens who reside outside the United States for less than 1 year and U.S. citizens re- siding abroad for 1 year or more who meet one of the following criteria: Owners or employees of U.S. business enterprises who reside abroad to further the enterprises' business and who intend to return within a reasonable period; U.S. Government civilian and military employees and members of their immediate families; and students who attend foreign educational institutions. Foreign residents include international institutions lo- cated in the United States, foreign nationals employed by their home Governments in the United States, and foreign affiliates of U.S. companies. The rest of the world consists of foreign residents who are transactors with U.S. residents. Real output and related measures The chain-type quantity and price indexes, in combina- tion with the current-dollar estimates, provide users with the basic data series from which all other analytical tables and presentations of the NIPA's are derived. The chained (1992) dollar estimates provide measures to calculate the percent changes for GDP and its components that are con- sistent with those calculated from the chain-type quantity indexes. These estimates also provide comparisons of levels over time and reasonable approximations of the rel- ative importance, and the contributions to growth in GDP, of most components for the years close to 1992. The chained (1992) dollar estimates are also used to compute certain key aggregates, such as per capita GDP. Quantity and price indexes Changes in current-dollar GDP measure changes in the market value of the goods and services produced in the economy in a particular period. For many purposes, it is necessary to decompose these changes into quantity changes and price changes. The changes in quantities and prices in the NIPA's are calculated using a Fisher formula that incorporates weights from two adjacent periods. For example, the 1992—93 change in real GDP uses prices for 1992 and 1993 as weights, and the 1992—93 change in prices uses quantities for 1992 and 1993 as weights.5 These annual changes are \"chained\" (multiplied) together to form time series of quantity and price. (For more details, see the box \"Basic Formulas for Calculating Chain-Type Quantity and Price Indexes.\") Because the Fisher formula allows 5. Because the source data available for most components of GDP are measured in dollars rather than in units, the quantities of most of the detailed components used to calculate percent changes are obtained by deflation. For deflation, quantities are approximated by real values (expressed at present with 1992 as the base period) that are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by its price index, where the price index uses 1992 as the base period. Two other methods, quantity extrapolation and direct base-year valuation, are also used to calculate the real values for a small number of the most detailed GDP components. For quantity extrapolation, the real values are obtained by extrapolating the base-year current-dollar estimates in both directions from the base period (1992) by quantity indicators; for example, the real values for mining exploration, shafts, and wells structures are extrapolated using oilwell footage drilled. For direct-base-year valuation, the real values are obtained by multiplying base-year prices by quantity data for each period; for example, the real values of natural gas inventories are calculated using quantities and prices of natural gas stocks.

    "text": "for the effects of changes in relative prices and in the composition of output over time, the resulting quantity or price changes are not affected by the substitution bias as- sociated with the fixed-weighted formula previously used to calculate changes in quantities and prices.6 The Fisher formula also produces results that are not affected by the choice of base periods. In addition, because the changes in quantities and prices calculated in this way are symmet- ric, the product of a quantity index and the corresponding price index equals the current-dollar index.7 Chain-type quantity and price indexes that correspond to most of the current-dollar output, product, and ex- penditure measures are presented in tables 7.1—7.14 and 7.17—7.20.8 Percentage changes from the preceding pe- riod for GDP and its major components and for other aggregates are presented in table 8.1. Contributions by major components to changes in real GDP are presented in table 8.2, which is discussed in more detail below. Chained-dollar measures BEA also prepares measures of real GDP and its compo- nents in a dollar-denominated form, designated \"chained (1992) dollar estimates.\" For GDP and most other se- ries, these estimates are computed by multiplying the 1992 current-dollar value by a corresponding quantity in- dex number and then dividing by 100.9 For example, if 6. For a discussion of the advantages of the Fisher index, see Jack E. Triplett, \"Economic Theory and BEA's Alternative Quantity and Price Indexes,\" SURVEY 72 (April 1992): 49-52; and J. Steven Landefeld and Robert P. Parker, \"BEA's Chain Indexes, Time Series, and Measures of Long-Term Economic Growth,\" SURVEY 77 (May 1997): 58-68. 7. For the annual estimates of NIPA aggregates that include the compo- nents the \"change in business inventories\" and \"change in Commodity Credit Corporation inventories,\" this relationship does not hold exactly, because of the price-data conventions used to calculate those components. In addition, for the quarterly estimates, all quarterly chain-type quantities and prices are adjusted to average to the corresponding annual estimates. For details on quarterly cal- culations, see the box \"Basic Formulas for Calculating Chain-Type Quantity and Price Indexes.\" 8. Indexes are not presented for change in inventories, for net exports, and for most of the \"net\" series in tables 7.5,7.7,7.11,7.13, and 7.20. Indexes for these series are not meaningful. 9. For change in business inventories (in tables 1.2,1.4,1.6,5.3,5.11,8.5, 8.7, and 8.9), real values are calculated as the difference between end-of-period and beginning-of-period chain-weighted stocks of inventories. The following \"real\" series are calculated as the current-dollar value of the series divided by an appropriate implicit price deflator: The chained-dollar values of gross national income and gross domestic income (in table 1.10), of command-basis exports of goods and services and receipts of factor income (in table 1.11), of gross and net domestic product of nonfinancial corporate business (in table 1.16), and of disposable personal income (in tables 2.1 and 2.9). For the following series, real values are calculated as the sum of, or the difference between, chained-dollar series: Net exports (in tables 1.2,8.5, and 8.7); command-basis gross national product (in table 1.11), foreign travel and other, net (in table 2.5); net foreign travel (in table 2.7); Federal consumption expenditures for durable goods, for nondurable goods, and for Commodity Credit Corporation inventory change (in table 3.8); net investment by major a current-dollar GDP component equaled $100 in 1992 and if real output for this component increased 10 per- cent in 1993, then the chained (1992) dollar value of this component would be $ 110 ($ 100 x 1.10) in 1993. For analyses of changes over time in an aggregate or in a component, the percentage changes calculated from the chained-dollar estimates and from the chain-type quantity indexes are the same; any differences will be small and due to rounding. However, because the relative prices used as weights for any period other than the base period differ from those used for the base period, the chained- dollar values for the detailed GDP components do not necessarily sum to the chained-dollar estimate of GDP or to any intermediate aggregate. A measure of the extent of such differences is provided in most chained-dollar tables by a \"residual\" line, which indicates the difference between GDP (or an other major aggregate) and the sum of the most detailed components in the table. For periods close to the base year, when there usually has not been much change in the relative prices that are used as the weights for the chain-type index, the residuals tend to be small, and the chained (1992) dollar estimates can be used to approximate the contributions to growth and to aggregate the detailed estimates. As one moves further from the base year, the residual tends to become larger, and the chained-dollar esti- mates become less useful for analyses of contributions to growth. For this reason, most of the chained- dollar detailed component series in this publication are shown beginning with 1982.10 In general, the use of chained-dollar estimates to calculate component shares or component contributions to real growth may be mis- leading for periods away from the base year. In particular, for components for which relative prices are changing rapidly, these calculations may be misleading even just a few years from the base year. To assist users in making valid comparisons across components for periods away from the base year, several changes have been made in the NIPA tables. Table 8.2 provides an accurate measure of the contributions of the major GDP components to the percentage change in real GDP for all periods. This table should be used for periods far from the base period, when the overall residual and the errors in contributions to growth become quite large. This table uses exact formulas for attributing growth to the components of GDP and of other aggregates, but the presentation is limited to the contributions to changes type (in table 5.3); and Federal defense and nondefense net purchases of used structures (in table 5.15). 10. Chained (1992) dollar estimates for selected series for earlier periods are shown in tables 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 1.10, 1.11, 1.16, 2.9, 5.11,5.13, and 8.3.

    "text": "Basic Formulas for Calculating Chain-Type Quantity and Price Indexes Annual indexes This box shows the basic calculations used to prepare annual and quarterly chain-type quantity and price indexes. The formula used to calculate the annual change in real GDP and other components of output and expenditures is a Fisher index (Qf) that uses weights for 2 adjacent years (years t - 1 and t). The formula for real GDP in year t relative to its value in year t - 1 is Qt = £pt-i<?t x where the p's and q's represent prices and quantities of detailed components in the 2 years. Because the first term in the Fisher formula is a Laspeyres quan- tity index (Qf-), or nL _ I.Pt-i4t ~ IPt-Hfe-i* and the second term is a Paasche quantity index (Qf), or n p ZPtdt Z Pth-i the Fisher formula can also be expressed for year t as the geometric mean of these indexes as follows: Qf = VQt xQf- The percent change in real GDP (or in a GDP component) from year t - 1 to year t is calculated as 100(Qf - 1.0). Similarly, price indexes are calculated using the Fisher formula p , = , ZPtlt-i „ £pt(It XPt-ilt-i XPt-ilt' which is the geometric mean of a Laspeyres price index (Pt L) and a Paasche price index (Pf), or pf = y j p t x p f . The chain-type quantity index value for period t is If = III xQf. and the chain-type price index is calculated analogously. Chain- type real output and price indexes are presented with the base year (b) equal to 100; that is, Ib = 100. The current-dollar change from year t - 1 to year t expressed as a ratio is equal to the product of the Fisher price and quantity indexes:1 IPt* = i>fxQ{. Quarterly indexes The same formulas are used to calculate the quarterly indexes for the most recent quarters, called the \"tail\" period; quarterly data are substituted for annual data. The tail period begins in the third quar- ter of the most recent complete year that is included in an annual or comprehensive NIPA revision, so the specific quarters covered change annually. Modified formulas are used to calculate the indexes for the other quarters, called the \"historical\" period. Quar- terly quantity data are used for the quantity indexes, and quarterly price data are used for the price indexes, but the weights—prices for a quantity index and quantities for a price index—are annual data. The weights that are used for the indexes in the historical pe- riod depend on the quarter being estimated. For each quarter, the weights for the closest 2 years are used: For the first and second quarters of a year, the weights are from that year and the preceding year; while for the third and fourth quarters, the weights are from that year and the next year. All quarterly chain-type indexes for completed years that have been included in an annual or comprehensive revision are adjusted so that the quarterly indexes average to the corresponding annual index. When an additional year is completed between annual revi- sions, the annual index is computed as the average of the quarterly indexes, so no adjustment is required to make the quarterly and annual indexes consistent. For example, until the 1998 annual revision is released, the chain-type indexes for the year 1997 are derived by averaging the four quarterly indexes for 1997. Chained-dollar estimates The chained-dollar value (CDf) is calculated by multiplying the index value by the base-period current-dollar value ( £ Pblb) and dividing by 100.2 For period t, CDf = ^ p b q b x l f / 1 0 0 . Implicit price deflators The implicit price deflator (JPDf) for period t is calculated as the ratio of the current-dollar value to the corresponding chained- dollar value, multiplied by 100, as follows: i p d f m Z.Pt4t 1FDt CDf x 100. 1.

    "text": "from the preceding year or quarter and to changes in the major components of GDP. (For details, see the box \"Cal- culation of Component Contributions to the Change in GDP.\") For some analytical purposes, it may be desirable to calculate contributions to growth for more than a single quarter or year, to calculate contributions to growth for aggregates other than GDP, or to work with real esti- mates that are denominated in dollars. Two articles in the SURVEY provide information on how to prepare chained- dollar series with different base periods that permit the calculation of close approximations of contributions to real growth or of relative changes for any period.11 These articles show how to calculate a chained-dollar series for any period by using the percent changes in the chain- type indexes to compute chained-dollar series indexed to the current dollars of whatever base period is appropri- ate for the analysis. In addition, these articles provide a number of chained-dollar series over frequently cited time periods, such as decades and business cycles. In computing these series, different base periods were used, depending upon the time period analyzed; for example, for decades and business cycles, the midpoints of the pe- 11. See Landefeld and Parker, \"BEA's Chain Indexes,\" 63-66; and J. Steven Landefeld and Robert P. Parker, \"Preview of the Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: BEA's New Featured Measures of Output and Prices,\" SURVEY 75 (July 1995): 31-38. riods were used. Tables 1.2A, 1.2B, and 1.2C present annual estimates of real GDP and its major components in chained (1937) dollars, chained (1952) dollars, and chained (1972) dollars, respectively. However, users should be aware that contributions calculated from these tables are approximations and may produce misleading results for periods far from those base periods or when relative prices are changing rapidly, such as during the energy crisis of 1973-75. In this publication, the presentation of chained-dollar estimates before 1982 has been limited to key aggregates, but the presentation of detailed quantity indexes, which are accurate for all periods, has been greatly expanded in tables 7.3—7.20. For GDP and its major components and for other measures of output, annual growth rates begin- ning with 1930 and quarterly growth rates beginning with the second quarter of 1947 are presented in table 8.1. In addition, the annual growth rates for major NIPA aggre- gates for 1970 to the present are shown each month in \"Historical Tables\" under \"National Data\" in the section \"BEA Current and Historical Data\" in the SURVEY. Price indexes BEA's featured aggregate price measure is the price in- dex for gross domestic purchases, which measures the prices paid for goods and services purchased by U . S . res- Calculation of Component Contributions to the Change in GDP Changes from preceding period The contributions to the change in real GDP provide a meas- ure of the composition of GDP growth that is not affected by the nonadditivity of the GDP components. Two formulas for the con- tributions of components to the percent change in real GDP are used—one for years following the base year, and the other for the base year and for years preceding the base year. For years following the base year, the contribution to the percent change in real GDP in year t at- tributable to the quantity change in component i (C%Aj,t) is C% Aiit = 100 x (Pu-iPf + P . , T ) X ( n u t - <FT,T-1) 2 x IPDf x CD[_, where CDf_, is the chained-dollar GDP in year t - 1 ; IPDf is the implicit price deflator for GDP in year t; piit is the price of component i in year t; Pf is the Paasche price index for GDP in year t; and is the quantity of component i in year t. For the base year and years preceding the base year, C%Aj,t is C%Aiit = 100 x ((Put /P{-)+Pi,t-i )x(ciu - Hi,t-\\) 2 x /PDf.j x CDf_, where Pj- is the Laspeyres price index for GDP in year t. Because these contributions to the percent change are additive, they can be used to calculate the contributions to subaggregates as well as the contributions of the detailed components. The formula used for the contributions for years after the base period can also be used for the most recent quarters (the \"tail\" period), except the quarterly results are expressed at annual rates.1 Changes over other periods Users can also prepare close approximations of contributions to real GDP growth or to the growth of other aggregates using chain- type annual-weighted indexes. In effect, users compute a chained- dollar series for a particular period using the percent changes in the chain-type annual-weighted indexes to compute chained-dollar series indexed to the current dollars of the base period appropriate for the analysis. (For references to additional information on these calculations, see footnote 11 in the text.) 1. The formulas must be modified for other quarters and for the most recent year because for these periods, chained output is calculated in a slightly different manner.

In contrast, the GDP price index measures the prices paid for goods and services pro- duced by the U.S. economy and is derived from the prices of PCE, gross private domestic investment, net exports, and government consumption expenditures and gross in- vestment. Thus, the two indexes differ with respect to coverage of the prices of exported and imported goods and services. Price changes in goods and services pro- duced abroad and sold in the United States are reflected in the gross domestic purchases measure but not in the GDP measure; price changes in goods and services pro- duced by the U.S. economy and sold abroad are reflected in the GDP price measure but not in the gross domestic purchases price measure. For example, a change in the price of imported petroleum that is fully passed on to U.S. consumers would be fully reflected in the price index for gross domestic purchases but not in the GDP price index, because imports are subtracted in deriving GDP. Implicit price deflators BEA also prepares another price index, the implicit price deflator (IPD), which is calculated as the ratio of the current-dollar value to the corresponding chained-dollar value, multiplied by 100 (see the box \"Basic Formulas for Calculating Chain-Type Quantity and Price Indexes\"). The values of the IPD are very close to the values of the corresponding chain-type price index for all periods.12 Implicit price deflators for GDP and its major compo- nents are presented as index numbers in table 7.1, and percentage changes from the preceding period for these measures are presented in table 8.1. Command-basis GNP and terms of trade BEA also prepares a measure of \"real\" output— command-basis GNP (see table 1.11). Command-basis GNP is a measure of the goods and services produced by the U.S. economy in terms of their purchasing power. GNP and command-basis GNP differ in how their real values are prepared: In estimating real GNP, the current- dollar values of the detailed components of exports of goods and services are deflated by export prices, the current-dollar values of the detailed components of im- ports of goods and services are deflated by import prices, and the current-dollar value of most factor income is deflated by the implicit price deflator for final sales to 12. The two measures of the price level differ only because of the factors cited in footnote 7. domestic purchasers. In estimating command-basis GNP, the current-dollar value of the sum of exports of goods and services and of receipts of factor income is deflated by the implicit price deflator for the sum of imports of goods and services and of payments of factor income. The terms of trade is a measure of the relationship between the prices that are received by U.S. producers for exports of goods and services and the prices that are paid by U.S. purchasers for imports of goods and services. It is measured by the following ratio, with the decimal point shifted two places to the right: In the numerator, the IPD for the sum of exports of goods and services and of receipts of factor income; in the denominator, the IPD for the sum of imports of goods and services and of payments of factor income. Changes in the terms of trade reflect the interaction of several factors, including movements in exchange rates, changes in the composition of traded goods and services, and changes in producers' profit margins. For example, if the U.S. dollar depreciates against a foreign currency, a foreign manufacturer may choose to absorb this cost by reducing the profit margin on the product it sells to the United States, or it may choose to raise the price of the product and risk a loss in market share. Classifications of production In the NIPA's, production is classified by the type of product, by the sector, by the legal form of organization, and by industry. Type of product Type of product classifications—goods (durable and non- durable), services, and structures—are presented for GDP and the components of final sales of domestic product. Goods are products that can be stored or inventoried, serv- ices are products that cannot be stored and are consumed at the place and time of their purchase, and structures are products that are usually constructed at the location where they will be used and that typically have long economic lives. If a product has characteristics of more than one of these classifications, it is classified on the basis of the dominant characteristic. Accordingly, the following products are included in goods: Restaurant meals; expenditures abroad by U.S. residents except for travel; replacement parts whose in- stallation cost is minimal; dealers' margins on used equipment; and movable household appliances, such as refrigerators, even when they are included in the purchase price of a new home.

In personal consumption expenditures, exports, im- ports, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment, durable goods have an average life of at least 3 years. In fixed investment, producers' durable equipment consists of goods that have an average life of at least 1 year. In change in business inventories, goods held by manufacturing and trade establishments are classified as durable goods or nondurable goods in accordance with the classification of the industry of the establishment holding the inventories. Inventories held by construction establishments are classified as durable goods; inventories held by all other establishments are classified as nondurable goods. Sector In the NIPA's, a breakdown of GDP is also shown in terms of the three sectors of the economy—business, households and institutions, and general government. Business: Production by all entities that produce goods and services for sale at a price intended at least to approximate the costs of production, corporate and non- corporate private entities organized for profit, and certain other entities that are treated as business in the NIPA's. These entities include mutual financial institutions, pri- vate noninsured pension funds, cooperatives, nonprofit organizations (that is, entities classified as nonprofit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in determining in- come tax liability) that primarily serve business, Federal Reserve banks, federally sponsored credit agencies, and 13. These certain goods are classified as services only for exports and imports. government enterprises.14 Business production also in- cludes the services of owner-occupied housing and of buildings and equipment owned and used by nonprofit in- stitutions that primarily serve individuals. Gross product of the business sector is measured as GDP less the gross product of households and institutions and of general government.15 Households and institutions: Production by house- holds, consisting of families and unrelated individuals, and by nonprofit institutions that primarily serve indi- viduals. Gross product of households and institutions is measured by the compensation paid to domestic workers and to the employees of these nonprofit institutions. General government: Production of all Federal Gov- ernment and State and local government agencies except government enterprises. Gross product of general gov- ernment is measured as the sum of the compensation of the employees of these agencies and of the consumption of fixed capital. Legalform of organization For the domestic business sector, income and its compo- nents are shown for four legal forms of organizations— corporate business, sole proprietorships and partner- ships, other private business, and government enterprises (employee compensation only). Corporate business: All entities required to file Federal corporate tax returns (IRS Form 1120 series). These enti- ties include mutual financial institutions and cooperatives subject to Federal income tax, private noninsured pension funds, nonprofit institutions that primarily serve business, Federal Reserve banks, and Federally sponsored credit agencies. Sole proprietorships: All entities that would be re- quired to file IRS Schedule C (Profits or Loss from Business) or Schedule F (Farm Income and Expenses) if the proprietor met the filing requirements, together with owner-occupied farm housing. Partnerships: All entities required to file Federal partnership income tax returns, IRS Form 1065 (U.S. Partnership Return of Income). Other private business: All entities that would be required to report rental and royalty income on the individual income tax return in IRS Schedule E (Supple- mental Income and Loss) if the individual met the filing requirements, tax-exempt cooperatives, owner-occupied nonfarm housing, and buildings and equipment owned 14.

Government enterprises: Government agencies that cover a substantial proportion of their operating costs by selling goods and services to the public and that main- tain their own separate accounts. A \"mixed\" treatment of government enterprises is used in the NIPA's: Some types of transactions are recorded as if they were part of the business sector, and others are recorded as if they were part of the general government sector. Government enterprises are treated like other busi- nesses and included in the NIPA business sector: (1) Their sales to final users are recorded as sales by private businesses, (2) their purchases of materials and busi- ness services are considered intermediate, and (3) their compensation payments and consumption of fixed capi- tal are deducted in calculating their income. Within the business sector, government enterprises are classified as noncorporate businesses. Government enterprises are treated like other govern- ment agencies: (1) Their interest payments are combined with those of general government rather than those of business, (2) their investment in equipment and struc- tures is combined with general government investment rather than with business investment in gross private do- mestic investment, and (3) their profit-like income, the current surplus of government enterprises (see definition on page M—8), accrues to general government. Industry Industrial distributions are presented for national income and its components, capital consumption allowances, employment and hours, and the change in business in- ventories and the stock of business inventories.16 The classification underlying the distributions of private ac- tivities is based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).17 The industry distributions in most of the tables in \"In- come, Employment, and Product by Industry\" (category 6) are shown as follows: Estimates for 1929-48 based on the 1942 SIC are shown in tables designated as part A; estimates for 1948-87 based on the 1972 SIC are shown 16. An industrial distribution of fixed investment based on data collected from establishments is prepared as part of the procedure used to estimate capital stock. Industrial distributions of gross product are also prepared; for further information, see Sherlene K..S. Lum and Robert E. Yuskavage, \"Gross Product by Industry, 1947-96,\" SURVEY 77 (November 1997): 20-34. 17. Office of Management and Budget, Statistical Policy Division, Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), 1988); Office of Management and Budget, Statistical Policy Division, Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1972); and Bureau of the Budget, Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1942 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1942). as part B; and estimates for 1987 forward based on the 1987 SIC are shown as part C. The industry distributions based on the 1987 SIC reflect the corresponding shift of most of the NIPA source data. The estimates for earlier years have not been adjusted to the 1987 SIC, because of a lack of adequate source data. Instead, the estimates for 1948 are shown on the basis of both the 1942 and 1972 SIC, and the estimates for 1987 are shown on the basis of both the 1972 and the 1987 SIC. Industrial distributions of government activities are not provided; instead, they are combined into a single cate- gory. For most series, separate estimates are shown for the activities of the Federal Government, of State and local governments, and of government enterprises. Expendi- tures by the Federal Government and by State and local governments are also shown by type and by function. The industrial distributions for private activities are based on data collected from \"establishments\" or from \"companies\" (also called enterprises or firms). Estab- lishments, as defined in the SIC, are economic units, generally at a single physical location, where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed. Companies consist of one or more es- tablishments owned by the same legal entity or group of affiliated entities. Establishments are classified into an SIC industry on the basis of their principal product or service, and companies are classified into an SIC indus- try on the basis of the principal SIC industry of all their establishments. Because large multiestablishment com- panies typically own establishments that are classified in different SIC industries, the industrial distribution of the same economic activity on an establishment basis can differ significantly from that on a company basis. For example, employment of steel-manufacturing companies differs from employment of steel-manufacturing estab- lishments because the employment of these companies includes the employment of establishments that are not classified in steel manufacturing and because it excludes the employment of establishments that manufacture steel but are not owned by steel-manufacturing companies. Industrial distributions on a consistent establishment or company basis are not available for all NIPA components. As a result, the industrial distribution of national income reflects a mix of establishment and company data. For the following series, the industrial distributions are based on establishment data: Compensation of employees, em- ployment, hours, inventories, rental income of persons, farm proprietors' income, farm net interest, and farm noncorporate capital consumption allowances. For non- farm proprietors, industrial distributions of proprietors' income, net interest, and capital consumption allowances are based on company data; these data are regarded Digitized for FRASER http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis",

    "text": "as being substantially the same as if they were based on establishment data because nearly all unincorporated companies own only one establishment (and the few mul- tiestablishment companies usually own establishments in the same SIC industry). For corporations, industrial distributions of profits, nonfarm net interest, and capital consumption allowances are based on company data. In addition, individual industry series are not fully com- parable over time. Historical comparability is affected primarily by two factors. First, the composition of indus- tries may change because of changes in the SIC basis that is used for the estimates. This factor affects estimates based on establishment data and on company data. Second, historical comparability is affected because the industrial classification of the same establishment or company may change over time. This factor affects company-based estimates much more than establishment- based estimates. The classification of a company may change as a result of the following: Shifts in the level of consolidation of entities for which company reports are filed; mergers and acquisitions; and other shifts in principal activities, especially for large diversified firms. In addition to the SIC industrial distributions of private activities, some NIPA tables show the following special SIC groupings, the titles of which correspond to the 1987 SIC: Financial industries consists of the following SIC industries: Depository institutions, nondepository in- stitutions, security and commodity brokers, insurance carriers, regulated investment companies, small business investment companies, and real estate investment trusts.18 Nonfinancial industries consists of all other private industries. Goods-producing industries consists of the following SIC divisions: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing; mining; construction; and manufacturing. Distributive industries consists of the following SIC divisions: Transportation (excluding the U.S. Postal Service); communications; electric, gas, and sanitary services; wholesale trade; and retail trade. Service industries consists of the rest-of-the-world sec- tor and the following SIC divisions: Finance, insurance, and real estate; and services. 18. Regulated investment companies, small business investment companies, and real estate investment trusts are included in the SIC classification \"holding and other investment offices\" and are not shown separately in the NIPA tables.

    "text": "Presentation of the NIPA's This section describes the release schedule for the NIPA estimates, the publication of the NIPA tables, and additional presentations of NIPA and NIPA-related estimates. Release schedule For gross domestic product (GDP) and most other NIPA series, quarterly estimates are released on the following schedule: \"Advance\" estimates are released near the end of the first month after the end of the quarter; as more detailed and more comprehensive data become available, \"preliminary\" and \"final\" estimates are released near the end of the second and third months, respectively. For gross national product, gross domestic income, national income, corporate profits, and net interest, ad- vance estimates are not prepared, because of a lag in the availability of source data. Except for the fourth-quarter estimates, the initial estimates for these series are released with the preliminary GDP estimates, and the revised esti- mates are released with the final GDP estimates. For the fourth-quarter, these estimates are released only with the final GDP estimates. Monthly estimates of personal income and outlays are released near the end of the month following the reference month; estimates for the preceding 2 to 4 months are subject to revision at that time. Annual revisions of the NIPA's are usually carried out each summer and cover the months and quarters of the most recent calendar year and of the 2 preceding years. These revisions are timed to incorporate newly available major annual source data. Comprehensive revisions are carried out at about 5- year intervals and incorporate the three major types of improvements described earlier: (1) Definitional and classificational changes, (2) statistical changes, and (3) presentational changes. Publication of the NIPA tables Tables that present the NIPA estimates appear each month under \"National Data\" in the section \"BEA Current and M—18 Historical Data\" in the SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS.19 The full set of NIPA tables consists of 142 tables that present annual, quarterly, and monthly estimates. These tables are grouped into nine categories: 1. National Product and Income 2. Personal Income and Outlays 3. Government Receipts, Current Expenditures, and Gross Investment 4. Foreign Transactions 5. Saving and Investment 6. Income and Employment by Industry 7. Quantity and Price Indexes 8. Supplemental Tables20 9. Seasonally Unadjusted Estimates Categories 1-5 are presented in volume 1 of this publication, and categories 6-9 are presented in volume 2. The NIPA tables are numbered as follows: The num- ber preceding the period is the category number, and the number following the period indicates the specific table in that category; for example, table 2.2 is the second table in the second category \"Personal Income and Outlays.\" The complete list of NIPA tables is shown in the table of contents. For each of these tables, the frequency of the estimate and the time period covered are given. In volume 2, the tables are followed by the \"Index to the NIPA Tables,\" which identifies the NIPA table (or tables) for each NIPA series and each topic covered by the NIPA's and which includes cross-references for commonly used business and economic terms to the appropriate NIPA item. 19. The NIPA estimates appear first in news releases, which are available to the general public in a variety of forms (see the box \"Data Availability\"). 20. In this category, the first table shows year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter percent changes in the major NIPA aggregates, and the second table shows contributions of the major expenditure components to the percent change in real GDP. The other tables show the following: Selected per capita series; auto and truck output, farm and housing sector accounts; detail on several components of gross national income (consumption of fixed capital, capital consumption adjustment, business transfer payments, supplements to wages and salaries, rental income of persons, dividends, and interest); NIPA imputations and the components affected; and reconciliations of several NIPA measures with the source data (for example, tax return tabulations) from which they are derived or to which they are closely related.

In addition, a set of \"Selected NIPA Tables\" is published monthly in the SURVEY; this set presents the estimates for the most recent six quarters and the most recent 2 years. The selected set comprises 57 tables from the first eight NIPA categories (seasonally unadjusted es- timates in the ninth category are compiled only once a year and thus are not included in the selected set of ta- bles). Because the numbering system used for the full set of tables is retained in the selected set, gaps occur in the numbering of the selected tables. A note preceding the NIPA tables indicates informa- tion on the vintage of the estimates. In general, the NIPA tables in the SURVEY present estimates for the most recent 2—4 years. Historical annual and quarterly esti- mates for summary NIPA series are presented annually in the SURVEY; see \"Summary National Income and Product Series, 1929-96\" in the August 1997 SURVEY. These es- timates cover the following: Current- and chained-dollar GDP for most of the components in NIPA tables 1.1 and 1.2 and for final sales of domestic product and gross national product; NIPA price indexes and implicit price deflators; and most of the major components of national income and personal income in NIPA tables 1.14 and 2.1. In addition, historical annual and quarterly estimates for the major NIPA aggregates are published monthly in the SURVEY. Additional presentations of NIPA and NIPA-related estimates The SURVEY also presents the following NIPA and NIPA- related estimates that do not fit neatly into the system or publication schedule for the standard NIPA presentation. \"Gross Domestic Product by Industry\" presents current- and chained-dollar estimates of gross product, or gross product originating, by industry, which is the contribution of each industry—including government— to GDP. Estimates for GDP by industry for 1947-96 were published in the November 1997 SURVEY. \"Reconciliation Tables\" in appendix A of the \"BEA Current and Historical Data\" section presents tables that reconcile NIPA estimates with related series and that pro- vide analytically useful extensions of the NIPA estimates. At present, tables in this section show the reconciliation of relevant NIPA series with related series in the bal- ance of payments accounts and the reconciliation of BEA compensation with Bureau of Labor Statistics earnings. \"Real Inventories, Sales, and Inventory-Sales Ratios for Manufacturing and Trade\"—in the January, April, July, and October issues of the SURVEY—shows quarterly and monthly estimates for these series. Also shown are quarterly and monthly inventories for manufacturing by stage of fabrication. Historical estimates for these se- ries, quarterly for 1977 forward, were published in the May 1996 SURVEY, and revised and new estimates for 1993—96 were published in the October 1997 SURVEY.

    "text": "Statistical Conventions Used for NIPA Estimates Most of the NIPA estimates are presented in current dollars. Changes in current-dollar estimates measure the changes in the market values of goods or services that are produced or sold in the economy. For many pur- poses, it is necessary to decompose these changes into price and quantity components. Prices are expressed as index numbers with the base period—at present, the year 1992—equal to 100. Quantities, or \"real\" measures, are expressed as index numbers with the base period (1992) equal to 100; for selected series, they are also expressed in chained (1992) dollars. (For further details, see the section \"Real output and related measures.\") Seasonal adjustment Quarterly and monthly NIPA estimates are seasonally adjusted at the detailed series level when statistically sig- nificant seasonal patterns are present. For most of the series that are seasonally adjusted by the source agency, BEA adopts the corresponding seasonal adjustment fac- tors. Seasonal adjustment removes from the time series the average effect of variations that normally occur at about the same time and in about the same magnitude each year—for example, weather and holidays. After seasonal adjustment, cyclical and other short-term changes in the economy stand out more clearly. Annual rates Quarterly and monthly NIPA estimates in current and chained dollars are presented at annual rates, which show the value that would be registered if the rate of activity measured for a quarter or a month were maintained for a full year. Annual rates are used so that periods of different lengths—for example, quarters and years—may be easily compared. These annual rates are determined simply by multiplying the estimated rate of activity by 4 (for quarterly data) or by 12 (for monthly data). Percent changes in the estimates are also expressed at annual rates. Calculating these changes requires a variant of the compound interest formula, where r is the percent change at an annual rate; GDPT is the level of activity in the later period; GDPq is the level of activity in the earlier period; m is the yearly periodicity of the data (for exam- ple, 1 for annual data, 4 for quarterly, or 12 for monthly); and n is the number of periods between the earlier and later periods (that is, t - 0).

    "text": "Appendix Updated Summary NIPA Methodologies This appendix presents summary descriptions of the principal source data and methods used to prepare the current-dollar estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) and the estimates of real GDP.22 These descriptions reflect the methodological improvements that were introduced in the annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPA's) that was released in July 1997 and the comprehensive revision of the NIPA's that was released in January 1996.23 Current-dollar estimates Table 1 lists the components of current-dollar GDP starting with the components on the product side and pro- ceeding to those on the income side. The subcomponents, with their dollar values for 1996, are grouped according to the methodology used to prepare them. The column for the annual estimates covers the revision cycle for those estimates and notes the major differences in methodology as the estimates move through the three annual revisions to a benchmark revision.24 For example, for \"most goods\" in personal consumption expenditures (the first item on the product side), the table indicates one methodology for benchmark years and another for all other years. The column for the quarterly estimates covers only the advance estimate for the current quarter—that is, the estimate prepared about a month after the end of the quarter. That estimate, rather than the preliminary or final quarterly estimate, is described because more attention focuses on the \"first look\" at the quarter. In addition, the column lists only the source data and methods; it does not indicate how many months of source data are available or whether the data are subject to revision by the source agency. Information on the key monthly source data appears each month in the \"Business Situation\" in the SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS. Additional information on 22. BEA has prepared a series of papers that provide detailed descriptions of NIPA concepts and methodologies. See the box \"Information About NIPA Methodology.\" 23. See the box \"Information About BEA Methodology.\" 24. For additional details on the release schedule for the NIPA estimates, see the section \"Presentation of the NIPA's\" in the text. the monthly source data used for the advance estimate is available online from the STAT-USA's Economic Bulletin Board and Internet services.25 The source data listed consist of a variety of economic measures, such as sales or receipts, wages and salaries, unit sales, housing stock, insurance premiums, expenses, interest rates, mortgage debt, and tax collections. For most components, the source data are \"value data\"; that is, they encompass both the quantity and price dimen- sions that are required for current-dollar estimates. In these cases, the methodology indicated in table 1 covers only the adjustment of the value data to derive estimates consistent with NIPA definitions and coverage. For those estimates not derived from value data, the table indicates the combination of data with separate quantity and price dimensions that is used to derive the required value estimate and the major adjustments needed to derive estimates consistent with NIPA definitions and coverage. On the product side, a \"physical quantity times price\" method is used for several components. For exam- ple, the estimate for new autos is calculated as unit sales times expenditure per auto (the average list price with op- tions, adjusted for transportation charges, sales tax, dealer discounts, and rebates). On the income side, an \"employ- ment times earnings times hours\" method and variations of a \"stock of assets/liabilities times an effective interest rate\" method are used for several components. Some of the source data shown in table 1 for the annual estimates are used as indicators to interpolate and extrap- olate the levels established by source data that are more comprehensive, and all of the source data shown for the advance quarterly estimates are used to extrapolate the level of the preceding quarter. In addition, extrapolation and interpolation may be based on trends, as is the case when \"judgmental trend\" is listed in the table.26 Estimating methods.—Table 1 refers to four methods— commodity flow, retail control, perpetual inventory, and 25. For additional information, see the box \"Data Availability.\" 26. For a few components, the final quarterly estimates are based on newly available source data that replace judgmental trends.

    "text": "fiscal year analysis—used by BEA for estimating specific components. The commodity-flow method is used to obtain the value of final users' purchases of goods and services (that is, commodities) for BEA's benchmark input-output ac- counts. These values serve as the benchmark for the NIPA estimates of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), of producers' durable equipment (PDE), and of the commodity detail for State and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment.27 This method is also used for PDE in nonbenchmark years, but it is implemented in an abbreviated form. An even more abbreviated commodity-flow method is used for current quarterly estimates of PDE. The retail-control method is used to estimate over one- third of the value of PCE for periods other than benchmark years. This method provides the indicator series used in extrapolating and interpolating the total of \"most goods\" and the \"control\" total to which the PCE categories and residential PDE included in this group must sum. These PCE categories consist of all goods except autos and trucks, food furnished to employees, food and fuel pro- duced and consumed on farms, standard clothing issued to military personnel, school lunches, and net foreign remittances.28 The perpetual-inventory method is used to derive esti- mates of fixed capital stock, which in turn form the basis for the estimates of consumption of fixed capital. This method is based on investment flows and a geometric depreciation formula; it is used instead of direct measure- ment of the capital stock because direct measurement is seldom statistically feasible on a comprehensive basis.29 The fiscal year-analysis method provides the frame- work for the annual and quarterly estimates of Federal Government consumption expenditures and gross invest- ment. The estimates of expenditures are prepared by program—that is, by activity for a group of line items or for an individual line item in the Budget of the U.S. Government. For most programs, the fiscal year analysis 27.

The expenditures total (as ad- justed) for a program is then classified by type of NIPA expenditure—for example, transfer payments and inter- est paid—with nondefense consumption expenditures and gross investment determined residually. When a fiscal year analysis is completed, the detailed array of NIPA ex- penditures by program and by type of expenditure serves as a set of control totals for the quarterly estimates.30 Balance of payments accounts.—The source data for the foreign transactions reflected in most NIPA components—such as net exports of goods and services and rest-of-the-world corporate profits—are the balance of payments accounts (BPA's), which are also prqpared by BEA.31 As noted in table 1, for some NIPA compo- nents, the BPA estimates are adjusted to conform to NIPA concepts and definitions.32 Annual estimates of these ad- justments and their definitions are shown in NIPA table 4.5, which was last published in the August 1997 SURVEY on page 82; summary quarterly estimates are shown in \"Reconciliation Tables\" in appendix A of the SURVEY. Other information.—In preparing the annual estimates of several of the income-side components, BEA adjusts the source data for various coverage and conceptual dif- ferences. For each subcomponent listed below, an annual NIPA table reconciles the value published by the source agency with the NIPA value published by BEA and iden- tifies the BEA adjustments. The following is a list of the subcomponents and their corresponding reconcilia- tion tables, which were last published in the September 1997 SURVEY beginning on page 34: Wages and salaries, table 8.25; farm proprietors' income, table 8.22; nonfarm proprietors' income, table 8.21; corporate profits, table 8.23; net interest, table 8.24; and consumption of fixed capital, table 8.20. 30. For additional information and an illustration of the fiscal year-analysis method, see U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Government Transactions, Methodology Paper Series MP-5 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988): 19-20. 31. See U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, The Balance of Payments of the United States: Concepts, Data Sources, and Estimating Procedures, (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990). (The methodologies described in this publication are subject to periodic improvements, which are typically introduced as part of the annual revision of the BPA's; these improvements are described in the SURVEY articles that cover the annual BPA revisions, most recently in \"U.S. International Transactions, Revised Estimates for 1974-96\"SURVEY 77 (July 1997): 43-55.) 32.

    "text": "Real estimates Table 2 shows which one of three methods—deflation, quantity extrapolation, and direct base-year valuation— is used to prepare the quantity index for each detailed product-side component of real GDP and identifies the source data with which the method is implemented.33 Deflation is used for most of the detailed components. In deflation, the quantity index is obtained by dividing the current-dollar index by an appropriate price index that has the base year—currently 1992—equal to 100 and then by multiplying the result by 100. The quantity-extrapolation and direct-base-year- valuation methods are similar in that they both use explicit 33. For additional information on the calculation of real GDP, see the section \"Real output and related measures\" in the text. quantity data. In quantity extrapolation, quantity indexes are obtained by using a quantity indicator to extrapolate from the base-year value of 100 in both directions. In direct-base-year valuation, quantity indexes are obtained by multiplying the base-year price by actual quantity data for the index period and then expressing the result as an index with the base year equal to 100. The subcomponents in table 2 are the same as those shown in table 1, but the detail differs to highlight the alternative methodologies used for calculating the real estimates.34 34. For the real estimates, the distinction between annual and quarterly methodologies is far less important than it is for the current-dollar estimates. For the relatively few cases in which the annual and quarterly source data differ, the major differences are noted in the entry.

For example, dur- ing the years of World War II, the residual line in this table, which is the difference between GDP and the sum of the most detailed component series in this table, is very large. During these years, because of spending associated with World War II, the share of GDP accounted for by government consumption expenditures and gross investment doubled before returning to a more normal share; in addition, the prices paid for goods and services throughout the economy were tightly controlled and very different from postwar levels. To assist users in historical analysis, BEA has provided supplemental tables that present estimates for selected timespans in chained 1937, 1952, and 1972 dollars (see tables 1.2A, 1.2B, and 1.2C). Users are also cautioned that particularly for components for which relative prices are changing rapidly, the use of chained-dollar estimates to calculate component shares or component contribu- tions to real growth may be misleading even just a few years from the base year. For accurate estimates of the contribu- tions to percent changes in real GDP, see NIPA table 8.2 in this volume. For a more detailed discussion of the use of chained dollars, includ- ing a method for closely approximating contributions to changes in real GDP for longer periods, see the section \"Chained-dollar measures\" on pageM-11.

Because the lOrmula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. Hie residual line following change in business inventories is the difference between gross domestic product and the sum of final sales of domestic product and of change in business inventories; the residual line following struc- tures is the difference between gross domestic product and the sum of the detailed lines of goods, of services, and of structures for 1982 and later periods. Prior to 1982, this residual line is calculated as the difference between gross domestic product and the sum of goods, services, and structures. Peicent changes from preceding period for selected items in this table are shown in table 8.1. Chain-type quantity indexes for the series in this table appear in table 7.17.

Gross domestic income deflated by the implicit price deflator for gross domestic product. 2. Gross national income deflated by the implicit price deflator for gross national product. NOTE.—Except as noted in footnotes 1 and 2, chained (1992) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 1992 current-doUar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained- dollar estimates are usually not additive. Chain-type quantity indexes for the series in this table appear in table 7.3. Digitized for FRASER http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis",

quantity index and the 1992 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive.

Aircraft ... Ships Vehicles Electronics Other equipment Addendum: Compensation of general government employees3 1. Gross government investment consists of general government and government enterprise expenditures for fixed assets; inventory investment is included in government consumption expenditures. 2. Consumption expenditures for durable goods excludes expenditures classified as investment except for goods transferred to foreign countries. 3. Compensation of government employees engaged in new force-account construction and related expenditures for goods and services are classified as investment in structures. The compensation of all general government em- ployees is shown in the addendum. 4. Consumption of fixed capital, or depreciation, is included in government consumption expenditures as a partial measure of the value of the services of general government fixed assets; use of depreciation assumes a zero net return on these assets.

Exports and imports of certain goods, primarily military equipment purchased and sold by the Federal Govern- ment, are included in services. Beginning with 1986, repairs and alterations of equipment were reclassified from goods to services. NOTE —Chained (1992) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 1992 current-dollar value ol the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. Chain-type quantity indexes for the series in this table appear in table 7.9. Digitized for FRASER http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis",

Beginning with 1967, exports and imports of gold in the NIPA's differs from that in the BPA's. BPA gold exports (line 2) and imports (line 13) are excluded from the NIPA's; imports of gold in the NIPA's (line 16) is the excess of the value of gold in gross domestic purchases over the value of U.S. production of gold. 2. BPA capital gains and losses included in U.S. direct investment income abroad (line 3) and in foreign direct investment income in the United States (line 14) are removed from the NIPA's beginning with 1974 for imports and with 1977 for exports. Beginning with 1982, U.S. direct investment income abroad in the BPA's excludes capital gains and losses associated with cuirency translation adjustments. 3. Transfers of goods and services under military grant programs, net, are classified as exports in the BPA's. In the NIPA's, these transactions are excluded from exports and included in Federal Government consumption ex- penditures. Beginning with 1988, the BPA's classify certain items as military grants that the NIPA's do noL 4. Consists of statistical revisions in the BPA's Slat have notyet been incorporated in the NIPA's. 5. Consists of arms shipments to Israel financed under the Emergency Security Act of 1973. In the NIPA's, these arms shipments are classified as military grants, which are included in the defense consumption expenditure compo- nent of GDP at the time they are acquired by the U.S. Government. Their transfer abroad is not reflected in the NIPA's. Beginning with 1988, the BPA's classify certain items as military grants that the NIPA's do not. 6. Consists of transactions between the United States and its territories, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The treatment of U.S. territories, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands in the NIPA's differs from that in the BPA's. In the NIPA's, they are included in the rest of the world; in the BPA's, they are treated as part of the United States. The adjustments to exports and imports of goods and services and to receipts and pay- ments of factor income are shown in lines 7 and 17, respectively. The adjustment to unilateral transfers, net (line 35) consists only of transfer payments from persons because transfer payments, subsidies, and grants-in-aid from the Federal Government to residents of U.S. territories, Puerto Rioo, and the Northern Mariana islands are excluded from NIPA transfer payments to the rest of the world. 7. In the BPA's, income transactions between parents and affiliates are recorded on a net basis. In BPA exports, U.S. parents' receiots from foreign affiliates for interest are net of such payments by U.S. parents to foreign affiliates. In BPA imports, US. affiliates' payments to foreign parents for interest are net of such receipts by U S. affiliates from foreign parents. In the NIPA s, these transactions are recorded on a gross basis beginning with 1974. The amount or adjustment is identical in payments and in receipts of factor income and, thus, does not affect NIPA net receipts of factor income or net foreign investment. In addition, for 1974 through 1981, royalties and license foes and other private seivices are recorded on a net basis in the BPA's but on a gross basis in the NIPA's. Beginning with 1982, these transactions are recorded on a gross basis in both the BPA's and the NIPA's. The amount of adjustment is identical in exports and in imports of seivices and, thus, does not affect NIPA net exports of goods and services or net foreign investment. 8. For 1946 through 1959, includes shipments to the United States from Alaska and Hawaii. Hiese are added to imports for 1946 to adjust to geographic coverage of imports to the 48-State coverage used in the NIPA's prior to i960. From 1947 through 1959, such shipments are negligible. Beginning with 1960, the adjustment is not re- quired because Alaska and Hawaii gained statehood In 1959. For 1959 through 1981, includes withheld nonresident taxes associated with royalties ana license fees, other private services, and income transactions. In the NIPA's, these transactions are recorded before the deduction of nonresident taxes withheld beginning with 1959. In the BPA's, the corresponding flows are recorded before the deduction of nonresident taxes withheld beginning with 1982. 9. Consists of financing provided to Israel in accordance with the Emergency Security Act of 1973; a U.S. Govern- ment payment to India under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act; less write-offs of loan principal owed to the U.S. Government, which are a type of financial transaction that Is excluded from the NIPA's.

Gross government investment consists ol general government and government enterprise expenditures for fixed assets; change in inventories is included in government consumption expenditures. NOTE —Chained (1932) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 1992 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. Chain-type quantity indexes for the series in this table appear in table 720. Digitized for FRASER http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis",

NOTE.-Chained (1992) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 1992 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula tor the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. The residual line is the difference between the first line and the sum of the most detailed lines Chain-type quantity indexes for the series in this table appear in table 7.7.

Beginning with 1932, this series is derived from the Census Bureau series \"current cost inventories.\" For earlier periods, it is derived from the Census Bureau \"book value inventories\" series. The series differ in the treatment o! inventories reported on a last-in, first-out (UFO) basis: The series prior to 1982 is a mix of UFO and non-LIFO inventories; the series beginning with 1982 is entirely on a non-UFO basis. 2. Beginning with 1973, the inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) shown in this table differs from the IVA that adjusts business incomes. The IVA in this table reflects the mix of methods (first-in, first-out last-in, first-out; etc.) underlying inventories derived primarily from Census Bureau statistics (see footnote 1). This mix differs from that underlying business income derived primarily from Internal Revenue Service statistics. Prior to 1973, the two IVA's are the same because information required for separate estimates is not available. 3. Prior to 1981, inventories of auto and home supply stores are included in motor vehicle dealers. Beginning with 1981, these inventories are included in \"other durable goods.\" NOTE.—Estimates lor nonfarm industries other than manufacturing and trade for 1986 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Manufacturing estimates lor 1981 and earlier periods and trade estimates for 1966 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 SIC; later estimates for these industries are based on the 1987 SIC. The resulting discontinuities are small. Digitized for FRASER http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis",

Inventories are as of the end of the quarter. Quarter-to-quarter changes calculated from this table are at quar- terly rates, whereas, the change in the business inventories component of GOP is stated at annual rates. 2. Prior Is 1959, inventories held by construction establishments are included in line 5. 3. Prior to 1981, inventories of auto and home supply stores are included in motor vehicle dealers. Beginning with 1981, these inventories are included in \"other durable goods.\" 4. Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross product of households and institutions and of general government and includes a small amount of final sales by farm. NOTE.—Chained (1992) dollar inventory series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the average of the end-of-year fixed-weighted inventories for 1991 and 1992, divided by 100. Chained (1992) dollar final sales series are calculated as the product of the chain-type index and the 1992 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula lor the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one penod, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. The residual line is the dif- ference between the first line and the sum of the most detailed lines for inventories. See note to table 5.10.

Federal Structures Equipment State and local Structures Equipment 1. Consists of general government and government enterprise expenditures for fixed assets. 2. Structures includes compensation of government employees engaged in new lorce-account construction and related expenditures for goods and services. 3. Consists of Department of Defense new structures, except family housing. 4. Consists primarily of general office buildings, police and fire stations, courthouses, auditoriums, garages, and passenger terminals. 5. Consists primarily of electric and gas facilities, transit systems, and airfields. NOTE.-Chained (1992) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 1992 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. The residual line is the difference between the first line and the sum of the most detailed lines, exduding the lines in the addenda. Chain-type quantity indexes for the series in this table appear in table 7.13. Digitized for FRASER http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis",
