  "3": "Table of Contents CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION The U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs) are a set of economic accounts that provide the framework for presenting detailed measures of U.S. output and income. This chapter introduces the NIPAs by answering several basic questions about their nature and purpose. CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS The NIPAs are based on a consistent set of concepts and definitions. This chapter establishes the type and scope of the economic activities that are covered by the NIPA measures, and it describes several of the principal NIPA measures of these activities. It then discusses the classifications used in presenting the NIPA estimates, and it describes the accounting framework that underlies the NIPAs. CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA The NIPAs incorporate a vast amount of data from a variety of public and private sources. This chapter describes the principal source data that are used to prepare the current quarterly NIPA estimates, to prepare the annual revisions of the NIPAs, and to prepare the quinquennia l comprehensive revisions of the NIPAs. CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS Estimating methods are the steps that are taken to transform source data into estimates that are consistent with the concepts, definitions, and framework of the NIPAs. This chapter briefly describes some of the general methods that are used to prepare the current -dollar, quantity, and price estimates for the NIPAs. An appendix describes some of the statistical tools and conventions that are used in preparing and presenting the NIPA estimates. CHAPTER 5: PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) is the NIPA measure of consumer purchases of goods and services in the U.S. economy. A technical note at the end of the chapter provides additional detail on the methodology for a number of key PCE components.",
  "4": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT Private fixed investment (PFI) is the NIPA measure of spending by private business, nonprofit institutions, and households on fixed assets in the U.S. economy. A technical note at the end of the chapter provides additional detail on the methodology for several key PFI components. CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES Change in private inventories is the NIPA measure of the value of the change in the physical volume of inventories owned by private businesses in the U.S. economy. Appendixes at the end of the chapter illustrate the relationship between business and NIPA inventory accounting and the basic steps used in the NIPA inventory calculations. CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES Net exports of goods and services is the difference between U.S. exports of goods and services, the NIPA measure of the portion of U.S. production that is provided to the rest of the world, and imports of goods and services, the NIPA measure of the portion of U.S. expenditures that is accounted for foreign-produced goods and services. CHAPTER 9: GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND GROSS INVESTMENT Government consumption expenditures and gross investment is the NIPA measure of the portion of final expenditures that is accounted for by the government sector. In the NIPAs, government is treated as both a consumer/investor and a producer of goods and se rvices. CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES Compensation measures the total income —both wages and salaries and supplements to wages and salaries —earned by employees in return for contributing to production during an accounting period. CHAPTER 11: NONFARM PROPRIETORS’ INCOME Nonfarm proprietors’ income provides a comprehensive and consistent economic measure of the income earned by all U.S. unincorporated nonfarm businesses. CHAPTER 12: RENTAL INCOME OF PERSONS Rental income of persons reflects the income earned by persons for the provision, to others, of their property.",
  "5": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS Corporate profits represents the portion of the total income earned from current production that is accounted for by U.S. corporations. A technical note at the end of the chapter describes BEA’s adjustments to the Internal Revenue Service’s tax return data. CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST NIPA m easures of interest reflect the charges for the provision of financial resources used in, or associated with, production in the U.S. Additional chapters (forthcoming) APPENDIX: SUMMARY NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS The line items that make up the seven summary national income and product accounts are defined. GLOSSARY This glossary presents the definitions of terms that are associated with the concepts, classifications, and accounting framework of the NIPAs and with the general sources and methods that are used to prepare the NIPA estimates.",

How useful are the NIPA estimates? How are the NIPA estimates prepared? Why are the NIPA estimates revised? Where are the NIPA estimates available? What are the NIPAs? The National Income and Product Accounts ( NIPAs ) are one of the three major element s of the U.S. national economic accounts. The NIPAs present the value and composition of national output and the types of incomes generated in its production. (For information on the concepts and definitions underlying the NIPAs, see “ Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts .”) The other major elements of the U.S. national economic accounts are the Industry Economic A ccounts (IEAs), which are also prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ), and the F inancial Accounts of the United States , (formerly the flow of funds accounts), which are prepared by the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System . The IEAs consist of the input -output ( I-O) accounts , which trace the flow of goods and services among industries in the production process and which show the value added by each industry and the detailed commodity composition of national output , and the gross domestic product (GDP) by industry accounts, which measure the contribution of each private industry and of government to GDP . 1 The financial accounts record the acquisition of nonfinancial and financial assets (and the incurrence of liabilities) throughout the U.S. economy, the sources of the funds used to acquire those assets, and the value of assets held and of liabilities owed . 2 In addition, BEA prepares two other sets of U.S. economic accounts : the international accounts, which consist of the International Transactions Accounts (formerly known as balance of payments accounts ) and the International Investment Position accounts ; and the Regional Economic A ccounts (REAs), which consist of the 1 See Mary L. Streitwieser, “ Measuring the Nation’s Economy: An Industry Perspective/ A Pri mer on BEA’s Industry Accounts ,” and U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Concepts and Methods of the U.S. Input -Output Accounts ; both are available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov . 2 See U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Guide to the Flow of Funds Accounts (Board of Governors, Washington, DC, 2006); and see Albert M.

Altogether, th e system of U.S. economic accounts present s a coherent, comprehensive, and consistent picture of U.S. econom ic activity (see Figure 1) . The NIPAs provide information to help answer three basic questions . First, what is the output of the economy —its size, its composition, and its use? Second, what are the sources and uses of national income? Third , what are the sources of saving , which provides for investment in future production? The NIPA estimates are presented in a set of integrated accounts that show U.S. production, income , consumption, investment, and saving. The concept ual framework of the accounts is illustrated by seven summary accounts , and detailed estimates are provided in approximately 300 supporting NIPA tables. The NIPA information is supplemented by a set of fixed -asset accounts , which show the U.S. stock of fixed assets and consumer durable goods.4 The NIPAs feature some of the most closely watched economic statistics that influence the decisions made by government officials, business es, and households. 3 For more information on BEA’s international or regional estimates, go to www.bea.gov ; s elect “Resources ” and then “Methodologies .” 4 See U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, 1925- 97, ( September 2003), available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov .

  "8": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-3 Foremost among the se estimates is G DP, the most widely recognized meas ure of the nation’s production. In particular, the quarterly estimates of inflation -adjusted GDP provide the most comprehensive picture of current economic conditions in the United States. Other key NIPA estimates include the monthly estimates of personal income and outlays , which provide current information on consumer income, spending, and saving, and the quarterly estimates of corporate profits, which provide an economic measure of U.S. corporate financial performance. How did the NIPAs originate ? Prior to the development of official statistics in the 1930s, there w ere only fragmentary and sometimes conflicting data on the state of the economy. This lack of comprehensive economic data hampered efforts to develop policies to combat the Great Depression. In response to this need, and in keeping with the economic identity that “income equals production,” the U.S. Department of Commerce commissioned future Nobel Laureate Simon Kuznets to develop estimates of national income to serve as an indicator of both U.S. income and U.S. output. 5 He coordinated the work of a group of researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research and of his staff at the Commerce Department, and initial estimates were presented in a 1934 report to the U.S. Senate, National Income, 1929 –32. Shortly thereafter, work began on monthly measures that could track income developments more quickly . These measures of income payments to individuals were first published in 1938 and were the predecessor of BEA’s personal income estimates. They revealed their usefulness immediately, as they showed that incomes had dropped 11 percent from a post -Great Depression peak in August 1937 to the recession trough in March 1938. Annual statistics could not track these developments. Similar efforts occurred internationally . In 1928, the League of Nations held the International Conference Relating to Economic Statistics to encourage countries to develop internationally comparable official statistics. As in the United States, the Great Depression underscored the urgency of developing reliable economic measures and in 1939 the League of Nations published national income estimates for 26 countries. As with the United States’ measures, the usefulness of the measures was quickly recognized . The planning needs for a wartime economy in the United States in the early 1940s highlighted the need for a measure of national production that could answer questions that national income measures could not address , such as the tradeoffs associated with mobilizing for war . Annual estimates of “gross national expenditure,” which gradually evolved to gross national product (GNP) , were introduced early in 1942 to provide information about major categories of expenditures in the economy; the measure also 5 The proposition that for a country a s a whole, goods a nd services produced must equal incomes earned by its residents is precisely true only for a closed economy. In the 1930s, when statistical measures were being formulated a nd international flows were r elatively small, the identity was retained by using a measure of production derived from labor and capital supplied by U.S. residents wherever the production takes place — that is, gross national product rather than gross domestic product.",
  "9": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-4 served as a complement to the estimates of national income.6 Over time, both the income and expenditure measures were refined and expanded. The first U.S. national income and product statistics were presented as part of a complete and consistent double -entry accounting system in the summer of 1947. The accounts presented a framework for classifying and recording the economic transactions among major sectors: households, businesses, government, and international (termed “rest of the world”). This framework placed the GNP statistics in the broader context of the economy as a whole and provided a more complete picture of how the economy works.7 International efforts also continued, and after the war, the League’s Committee of Statistical Experts formed a Sub -Committee on National Income Statistics , which produced a report in 1947, written by Sir Richard Stone.8 This report was the foundation of the modern-day System of National Accounts (SNA) —the internationally accepted guidelines for the compilation of national accounts. How have the NIPAs evolved? The evolution of the NIPAs from their earliest origins in the 1930s to their current form exemplifies the balance between theoretically ideal measures, the availability of source data and other resources, and the economic questions of the day. Put another way, the NIPAs evolved, and continue to evolve, in an effort to produce the best possible measures of the economy that are at once accurate, reliable, and relevant. The improvements BEA introduced into its accounts over the years have reflected its own experience, research and strategic planning , and the recommendations of scholars and other experts. For example, in the 1950s, there were two major reviews of the accounts, one by the National Bureau of Economic Research and another by the Conference on Research in Income and Wealth. 9 In 1971, BEA published a special volume commemorating its 50th anniversary that contained recommendations contributed by some of the country’s most prominent economists .10 Also in the 1970s, reports were prepared by the Advisory Committee on Gross National Product Data Improvement and by the Conference on Research in Income and Wealth; in 1982, the General Accounting 6 Until 1991, GNP was the featured measure of U.S. production.

Since 1993, BEA has incorporated many improvements to the NIPAs and its other economic accounts that have resulted in increased consistency with major SNA guidelines on GDP, investment, and saving. 14 As a result of these continuous efforts, a t the end of 1999, the Commerce Department named the invention and ongoing development of the NIPAs and its marquee measure GDP as “its greatest achievement of the century.”15 The following are examples of some of the major changes that have been introduced into the NIPAs to keep them accurate and relevant in the face of a changing economy. • In the early 1950s, BEA developed and began to publish inflation-adjusted, or “real,” measures of output in response to inflation concerns that had persisted since WWII and in order to assess trends in national productivity and standards of living . Later in the same decade, BEA introduced measures of personal income by size and by state in response to similar needs for information on the composition of consumer markets .

Interest payments to individuals were excluded from GNP to better reflect productive activity. • In the 1970s, BEA introduced economic measures of capital consumption that were valued at replacement cost rather than historical cost to better reflect the depletion of capital assets and to enhance the picture of the Nation’s productive capacity . • In the 1980s, BEA significantly expanded its coverage of international trade in services in response to the growing size and diversity of the se global transactions. • In the 1990s, BEA introduced more accurate measures of real output and of prices, developed estimates of investments in computer software, instituted the treatment of government purchases of structures , equipment , and software as investment, and incorporated improved measures of high-tech products. • In the 2000s, BEA introduced improved measures of insurance and banking services, a new treatment of government as a producer of goods and services, a new treatment of disasters to better reflect the distinctions between current and capital transactions, a new improved format for presenting the NIPAs , and an updated classification system for personal consumption expenditures to provide more useful categories for analysis of spending by households and nonprofit institutions serving households . • In 2013 , BEA expanded the asset boundary in the accounts by recognizing expenditures by business, government, and nonprofits institutions serving households for research and development and expenditures by private enterprises for the creation of entertainment, literary , and artistic originals as fixed investment to allow better measurement of the effects of innovation and intangible assets on the economy. BEA also began measuring pension income on an accrual basis. • In 2018, BEA completed a multi-year initiative to improve its seasonal adjust ment in the NIPAs , and it introduced measures of GDP and GDI and their major components that are not seasonally adjusted. • In 2020, as part of BEA’s ongoing efforts to harmonize the production and publication of the NIPAs, the IEAs, and the Regional Economic Accounts, BEA synchronized the production and release of quarterly NIPA, IEA, and REA statistics . • In 2022 and 2023, BEA took the final steps in harmonizing its accounts by concurrently producing and publishing annual and comprehensive updates , respectively, of the NIPA, IEA, and REA statistics.

  "12": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-7 them to follow and understand the performance of the U.S. economy. The following are among the principal uses of the NIPA estimates. • Since their inception in the 1930s and 1940s, the NIPAs have become the mainstay of modern macroeconomic analysis. They provide comprehensive and consistent time series that can be used for measuring the long -term path of the U.S. economy, for analyzing tr ends and identifying factors in economic growth and productivity, and for tracking cyclical fluctuations in economic activity. • The NIPAs provide the basis for macroeconomic forecasting models. These mathematical models are developed using historical NIPA estimates and other variables with the aim of predicting short -term economic activity or long -term economic trends. • Key NIPA estimates serve as primary indicators of the current condition of the U.S. economy. In particular, the releases of the quarterly estimates of GDP and its components, of the quarterly estimates of corporate profits, and of the monthly estimates of personal income and personal consumption expenditures are closely anticipated and followed by Wall Street investors and analysts, the news media, and the general public. • The NIPA estimates provide critical inputs to the formulation and execution of macroeconomic policy and to the assessment of the effects of these policies. They are used by the White House and by Congress in formulating fiscal policy and by the Federal Res erve Board in formulating monetary policy. • The NIPA estimates are used by the White House and Congress in preparing the federal budget and tax projections. • The NIPA estimates are used in comparisons of the U.S. economy with the economies of other nations. Comparable international statistics facilitate assessments of relative economic performance among nations, and they provide the basis for tracking and analyzing the global economy. • Detailed NIPA estimates can be used in examining interrelationships between various sectors of the economy. For example, estimates of benefits paid under government assistance programs track flows of transfer payments from governments to households. • The NIPA estimates are used by businesses and individuals in planning financial and investment strategies. Such planning heavily depends on the near - and long - term prospects for economic growth. • The NIPAs are an important data source for the other national economic accounts and other economic statistics. For example, the NIPA estimates of owner - occupied housing, of motor vehicle output, and of bank-service charges are among the primary source data used in preparing the I -O accounts. In addition, the NIPA estimates are used in various analytical measures; for example, business -sector output is used as the numerator in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ estimates of productivity for the U.S. economy. • The NIPA framework provides the basis for developing analytical tools such as satellite accounts, which are supplementary accounts that focus on a particular aspect of economic activity or on the activities of a specific sector or segment of",
  "13": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-8 the economy. For example, the NIPAs provide the structural and statistical basis for the travel and tourism satellite accounts. How useful are the NIPA estimates? The usefulness of the NIPA estimates is determined by how effective they are in meeting the above needs. This effectiveness may be summarized in terms of four characteristics: accuracy, reliability, relevance, and integrity. Accuracy . Accuracy may be described in terms of how close the estimates come to measuring the concepts they are designed to measure. In the case of GDP, the estimate is accurate when it captures all production for final use but does not include production for inte rmediate use. In order to keep pace with innovations in the economy, such as the development of new online services, BEA must periodically review and update the definitions and methodologies of the NIPA aggregates and components to ensure that they represent complete and consistent estimates. Reliability . Reliability refers to the size and frequency of revisions t o the NIPA estimates. An important indicator of reliability is the effectiveness of the initial estimates of GDP in providing a useful picture of U.S. economic activity. The results of periodic studies have confirmed that the initial estimates provide a re liable indication of whether economic growth is positive or negative, whether growth is accelerating or decelerating, whether growth is high or low relative to trend, and where the economy is in relation to the business cycle. 16 Relevance. Relevance has two dimensions. First, relevance refers to the length of time before the estimates become available. Estimates that are not available soon enough for the intended use are not relevant. However, there is an implicit tradeoff between timeliness and accuracy, so BEA has developed a release cycle for the estimates that addresses this tradeoff (see the section “Why are the NIPA estimates revised ?”). Second, relevance refers to the ability of the accounts to provide summary and detailed estimates in analytical frameworks that help answer the qu estions being asked about the economy. Issues of relevance change as the economy changes, as policy concerns evolve, and as economic theory advances; as discussed above, BEA’s accounts have evolved over time in order to maintain their relevance . Integrity. One critical factor underlying the usefulness of the accounts is confidence on the part of users that the NIPA estimates represent a truthful picture of the economy. That is, the preparation and release of the estimates must reflect the best methods and technical judgments available, free from any political or other inappropriate influence. 16 For more infor mation, see Dennis J. Fixler, Eva de Fra ncisco, and Da nit Ka nal , “Revisions to GDP, GDI, and Their Major Components ,” S urvey 100 (January 2021).",
  "14": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-9 In recognition of the importance of its statistics and the trust placed in their integrity, BEA strives to make its processes open and transparent and its releases objective and timely. For example, the NIPA estimates that are designated as “principal econ omic indicators” —GDP, personal income and outlays, and corporate profits —are prepared in accordance with Statistical Policy Directive Number 3 of the Office of Management and Budget, which provides standards for data collection, estimation, and evaluation and for the timely and orderly release of these sensitive economic statistics. BEA employs such standards in the preparation of all of its estimates. As Alan Greenspan, former Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, stated about the national economic accounts, and specifically the estimates of GDP: Though these estimates have a profound influence on markets when published and are the basis for federal budget projections and political rhetoric, I do not recall a single instance when the integrity of the estimates was called into question by informed observers. This is so despite the fact that, for many of the published preliminary figures, judgmental estimates for data not yet available are made, many of which affect the message of the accounts. It is a testament to the professionalism of the analysts that these judgments are never assumed to be driven by political imperatives. This cannot be said of statistical operations of all countries, and I think it is fair to say that the consequent ability of people to make decisions with greater confidence in t he information at their disposal has contributed, in at least a small way, to our nation’s favorable economic performance. 17 How are the NIPA estimates prepared? The NIPA estimation process starts with identif ying and obtaining source data that are appropriate as the basis for the estimates. These data largely originate from public sources, such as government surveys and administrative data, and they are supplemented by data from private sources, such as data from trade associations. (For more information, see “ Chapter 3 : Principal Source Data .”) Ideally, the source data for each detailed component of the NIPAs would correspond exactly to the concept s and structure of the accounts . Additionally , these data would be accurate, would have the needed coverage, would have the appropriate time of recording and valuation, and would be available quickly. I n practice, the source data will never meet all of these criteria. Thus, BEA must develop estimating methods that adjust the data to the required concepts and that fill gaps in coverage and timing. (For more information, see “ Chapter 4: Estimating Methods .”) 17 “GDP: One of the Great Inventions of the 20th Century ,” 13.",
  "15": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-10 Why are the NIPA estimates revised ? BEA re vises the NIPA estimates for two related reasons. First, as noted earlier, the NIPA s serve a multitude of purposes, some of which require frequent and immediately available estimates and others of which require consistent, long -term time series . Second, m uch of the source data that BEA uses to prepare the estimates are part of statistical programs that provide, over time, more complete or otherwise better coverage—for example, monthly surveys that are superseded by an annual survey that is drawn from a larger sample or that collects more detailed information. To address this implicit trade off between estimates that are the most timely possible and estimates that are the most accurate possible, BEA has developed a release cycle for the NIPA estimates . This cycle progresses from current quarterly estimates , which are released soon after the end of the quarter and which are based on limited source data , to comprehensive -update estimates , which are released about every 5 years and which incorporate the most extensive source data available. For GDP and most other NIPA series, the set of three current quarterly estimates are released on the following schedule. “Advance” estimates are released near the end of the first mon th after the end of the quarter. M ost of these estimates are based on initial data from monthly surveys for either 2 or 3 months of the quarter ; where source data are not yet available, the estimates are generally based on previous trends and judgment (see the box “Source Data and Key Assumptions for the Advance Estimates of GDP for the First Quarter of 2014 ” in the section “Source data for the current estimates” in Chapter 3).18 “Second ” and “third ” quarterly estimates are released near the end of the second and third months, respectively; these estimates incorporate new and revised data from the monthly surveys and other monthly and quarterly source data that ha ve subsequently become available. The current quarterly estimates provide the first look at the path of U.S. economic activity. 19 Annual updates of the NIPAs are released each September .20 These updates incorporate source data that are based on more extensive annual surveys , on annual data from other sources, and on later revi sions to the monthly and quarterly source data, and 18 Infor mation on the assumptions used for unavailable source data is provided in a technical note that is posted with the GDP news release on BEA's website . Within a few days after the release, a detailed \"Key Source Data and Assumptions\" file is posted on the website . Additionally, in the middle of each month, an analysis of the current quarterly estimate of GDP and related series , including information on key source data and assumptions, is ma de availa ble in the Survey of Current Business article \"GDP a nd the Economy.\" 19 Unless noted otherwise, annual data are presented on a calendar -year basis (i.e., covering January through December). Quarter ly data are also presented on a calendar basis (i.e., the first quarter (Q1) covers January, February, and March; Q2 covers April, May, and June; Q3 covers July, August, and September; and Q4 covers October, November, and December). 20 Prior to the 2022 concurrent release of the NIPAs, IEAs, and REAS, the annual update of the NIPAs was typically released in July; the release of all three accounts spanned several months from July to October. The timing was shifted to September to allow a concurrent release of the three accounts.",

Comprehensive updates are carried out at about 5 -year intervals and may result in revisions that extend back for many years .22 These estimates incorporate the best availabl e source data, such as data from the quinquennial U.S. Economic C ensus . Comprehensive updates also provide the opportunity to make definitional, statistical, and presentational changes that improve and modernize the accounts to keep pace with the ever-changing U.S. economy. Thus, these NIPA estimates represent the most accurate and relevant picture of U.S. econom ic activity . Where are the NIPA estimates available? Information on the NIPA estimates is provided in BEA news releases , in BEA’s monthly journal, the Survey of Current Business , and on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov . News releases provide the earliest information on the current quarterly NIPA estimates and the annual and comprehensive revisions of the NIPAs . These releases, which contain a brief description of the estimates and summary data tables, are posted on BEA’s website by 8:30 on the morning of the release in accordance with a previously published schedule . The most comprehensive source of the latest vintage of NIPA data is BEA’s website presentation of the entire set of NIPA tables, which is updated soon after the news release is posted . The website provides t he estimates in an interactive environment that enables users to view and download specified tables for selected time spans and in a variety of formats.23 In addition, the website provides descriptions of the methodologies underlying the estimates and release schedules for the estimates, as well as articles and working papers that describe BEA’s current research . Users can be notified via e-mail, RSS feeds, and Twitter accounts of new data releases. The current NIPA estimates are also discussed each month in the article “GDP and the Economy” in the Survey and are presented in a set of selected NIPA tables. The annual and comprehensive updates are described in Survey article s after the ir release. 21 As part of the 2018 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA changed the typical open period for annual updates of the NIPAs from 3 to 5 years . As part of the “flexible” approach to annual updates that BEA introduced in 2010, the open period may be extended beyond 5 years to allow for the incorporation of improvements in methodology . See Pamela A. Kelly, Stephanie H. McCulla, and David B.

  "17": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-12 Articles that explain changes in definitions, methodologies, and presentations made in connection with the annual and comprehensive update s and articles on other topics related to the NIPAs are published periodically. The presentation of the NIPA tables is organized to group tables by major topic, such as the components of GDP, saving and investment, and income . For example, most government sector tables are shown in section 3. To assist users in identifying the type of estimate in a table, BEA developed a table -numbering system that highlights the type of estimate (such as current dollars, quantity indexes, and percent changes) in the table. The system is outlined below. Table numbers are in the format “X.Y.Z.” where “X” indicates the NIPA table section, “Y” indicates the table family within the section, and “Z” indicates the metric, or type, of estimate presented. The table sections are numbered as follows: 1.Domestic Product and Income 2.Personal Income and Outlays 3.Government Current Receipts and Expenditures 4.Foreign Transactions 5.Saving and Investment 6.Income and Employment by Industry 7.Supplemental Tables 8.Not Seasonally Adjusted The table families within each section (charac ter “Y”) h ave table stubs, or lines, that are generally the same. The metric types (character “Z”) are numbered as follows: 1.Percent change from preceding period in real estimates (most at annual rates) 2.Contributions to percent change in real estimates 3.Real estimates, quantity indexes 4.Price indexes 5.Current dollars 6.Real estimates, chained dollars 7.Percent change from preceding period in prices 8.Contributions to percent change in prices 9.Implicit price deflators 10.Percentage shares of GDP 11.Percent change from quarter one year ago (available only for real GDP) For example, GDP is presented in table group 1.1; the current -dollar estimates are presented in table 1.1.5, and the chained-dollar estimates are presented in table 1.1.6.

According to the international System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA), “ Economic production may be defined as an activity carried out under the control and responsibility of an institutional unit that uses inputs of labour, capital, and goods and services to produce outputs of goods or services. There must be an institutional unit that assumes responsibility for the process of production and owns any resulting goods or knowledge -capturing products produced or is entitled to be paid, or otherwise compensated, for the change-effecting or margin services provided. ” 1 1 Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co - opera tion a nd Development, United Na tions, a nd the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008 : 6.24 at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/SNA2008.asp .",
  "20": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-2 Under this definition, certain natural processes may be included in or excluded from production, depending upon whether they are under the ownership or control of an entity in the economy. For example, the growth of trees in an uncultivated forest is not included in production, but the harvesting of the trees from that forest is included. The general definition of the production boundary may then be restricted by functional considerations. In the SNA (and in the U.S. accounts) , certain household activities —such as housework, do-it-yourself projects , and care of family members —are excluded , partly because by nature these activities tend to be self -contained and have limited impact on the rest of the economy and because their inclusion would affect the usefulness of the accounts for long-standing analytical purposes , such as business cycle analysis .2 In the U.S. economic accounts , the production boundary is further restricted by practical considerations about whether the productive activity can be accurately valued or measured. For example, illegal activities , such as gambling and prostitution in some states, should in principle be included in measures of production. However, these activities are excluded from the U.S. accounts because they are by their very nature conducted out of sight of public scrutiny and so data are not available to measure them . Asset boundary In general, the boundary for assets in the U.S. economic accounts is comparable to that for production. According to the SNA, assets “are entities that must be owned by some unit, or units, and from which economic benefits are derived by their owner(s) by holding or using them over a period of time.” 3 Economic assets may be either financial assets or nonfinancial assets. Financial assets consist of all financial claims —that is, the payment or series of payments due to a creditor by a debtor under the terms of a liability —shares or other equity in corporations plus gold bullion held by monetary authorities as a reserve asset . 4 These assets are covered in the financial accounts of the United States , which are maintained by the Federal Reserve Board. Two broad categories of nonfinancial assets are identified. Produced assets are assets that have come into existence as a result of a production process. The three types of produced assets are the following: f ixed assets , inventories, and valuables such as precious metals that are primarily held as stores of value . Nonproduced assets are assets that ar ise from means other than a production process ; a primary example is natur ally occurring resources , such as mineral deposits and u ncultivated forests.5 2 SNA 2008: 6.28– 6.29.

  "21": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-3 At present, BEA prepares estimates of capital stocks for private and government fixed assets , for inventories owned by private business, and for consumer durable goods (which are included in BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts ).6 • Fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly, or continuously, in the processes of production for more than 1 year. BEA’s estimates of fixed assets cover structures, equipment, and intellectual property products , but not cultivated assets such as livestock or orchards. The acquisition of fixed assets by private business is included in the NIPA measure “ gross private domestic investment, ” and the acquisition of fixed assets by government is included in the NIPA measure “government consumption expenditures and gross investment. ” The depre ciation of fixed assets —that is, the decline in their value due to physical deterioration , normal obsolescence, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event —is captured in the NIPA measure “consumption of fixed capital.”7 • The stock of private inventories consists of materials and supplies, work in process, finished goods, and goods held for resale. T he change in private inventories is included in the NIPA measure “gross private domestic investment. ” • Consumer durable goods are tangible commodities purchased by consumers that can be used repeatedly or continuously for a prolonged period (for example, motor vehicles). Purchases of these goods are included in the NIPA measure “personal consumption expenditures .” Thus, in the NIPAs, acquisitions of fixed assets by private business and by government are treated as investment, but acquisitions of consumer durable goods by households are treated as consumption expenditures rather than as investment. 8 Sometimes , the asset boundary may change as a result of changes in definition or in the ability to measure or value an asset. For example, in the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA introduced t wo major changes that broadened the definition of fixed investment and thus expanded the boundary of its capital stock estimates. First, BEA began treating expenditures by business, government, and nonprofit institutions serving households for research and development as fixed investment. Second, BEA began t reating expenditures by business and nonprofit institutions serving households on entertainment, literary, and other artistic originals as fixed investment . These changes recognize that these intangible assets have ownership rights, are long -lasting, and are mineral resources. See “ Integrated Economic and Environmental Satellite Accounts ,” Survey 74 (April 1994): 33 –49; and “ Accounting for Mineral Resources: Issues and BEA’s Initial Estimates ,” Survey 74 (April 1994): 50 –72. 6 See “ Fixed Assets,” in BEA’s “ Interactive Data ,” at www.bea.gov . 7 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of disasters in which the value of irreparable damage to, or the destruction of, fixed assets is no longer recorded as consumption of fixed capital; see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, “ Preview of the 2009 Comprehensive Revision of the NIPAs: Changes in Definitions and Presentations ,” S urvey 89 (March 2009): 10 -27. 8 However, estimates of the stocks of consumer durables are included in household balance sheets in the Federal Reserve Board’s financial accounts of the United States as well as in BEA’s capital stock estimates.",

Private investment in research and development and in entertainment originals , along with that in software (which has been treated as a fixed asset since the 1999 comprehensive NIPA revision) , is now shown in the NIPAs in the subcategory “intellectual property products” in nonresidential fixed investment. Similarly, government investment in research and development, along with that in software, is shown in “intellectual property products” in gross government fixed investment. Also as part of the 2013 comprehensive update , BEA began recognizing as capital investment all of the nonfinancial ownership transfer costs that are associated with the purchase of a residential asset . These costs include title insurance; title, abstract, and attorney fees; payments for state and local government documentary and stamp taxes; and payments for surveys and engineering services; as well as the previously capitalized brokers’ commissions on the sale of residential structures . 9 Market and nonmarket output The o utput that is included in the economic accounts is classified as “market ,” “produced for own use,” or “nonmarket.” Most production and distribution takes place within the market economy—that is, goods and services are produced for sale at price s that are “economically significant .”10 Thus, the current market price of the produced good or service provides a rational and viable basis for valuing this production. Output for own final use consists of goods and services that are retained by the owners of the enterprises that produced them. Such output includes food produced on farms for own consumption, special tools produced by engineering firms for own use, and specialized software developed or improved in-house rather than purchasing custom - made software from a software development company. Goods or services produced for own final use are valued at the market prices of similar products or by their costs of production. 11 Nonmarket output consists of goods and of individual or collective services that are produced by nonprofit institutions and by government that are supplied for free or at prices that are not economically significant. Individual services, such as education and health services , are provided at below -market prices as a matter of social or economic policy. Collective services, such as maintenance of law and order and protection of the environment, are provided for the benefit of the public as a whole and are financed out of funds other than receipts from sales. The value s of the nonmarket output of nonprofits and of government are estimated based on the costs of production. 12 9 For more infor mation, see “ Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: Changes in Definitions and Presentations ,” S urvey 93 (March 2013): 13 –39. 10 Prices are “economically significant” when they have a significant influence on the amounts the producers are willing to supply and on the amounts the purchasers are willing to buy; see SNA 2008: 6.95. 11 See SNA 2008: 6.114, 6.124 –6.125. 12 See SNA 2008: 6.128 –6.129.",
  "23": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-5 In the NIPAs, a number of imputations for own-use and nonmarket transactions are made in order to include in the accounts the value of certain goods and services t hat have no observable price and are often not associated with any observable transaction.13 Additionally, imputations keep the accounts invariant to how certain activities are carried out (for example, an employee may be paid either in cash or in kind). 14 Both a measure of production and the incomes associated with that production are imputed (for example, the imputation for food furnished to employees is included in PCE and in personal income). The largest NIPA imputation is that made to approximate the value of the services provided by owner -occupied housing . This imputation is made so that the treatment of owner -occupied housing in the accounts is comparable to that for tenant -occupied housing (which is valued by rent paid), thereby keeping GDP invariant as to whether a house is owned or rented. In th e NIPAs, the purchase of a new house (excluding the value of the unimproved land) is treated as an investment, the ownership of the home is treated as a productive enterprise, and a service is assumed to flow, over its economic life, from the house to the occupant. For the homeowner, the value of this service is measured as the income the homeowner could have received if the house had been rented to a tenant. Another large imputation is that made to account for services (such as checking - account maintenance and loan services to borrowers) provided by banks and other financial institutions either without charge or for a small fee that does not reflect the entire value of the service. For the depositor, this “imputed interest” is measured as the difference between the interest paid by the bank and the interest that the depositor could have earned by investing in “safe” government securities (referred to as the “r eference rate”) . For the borrower, it is measured as the difference between the interest charged by the bank and the interest the bank could have earned by investing in those government securities. 15 Geographic coverage Another important consideration is the geographic boundary that defines wha t is included in the accounts. In the NIPAs, and in the industry accounts, the “U.S. estimates ” cover the 50 states , the District of Columbia, and U.S. military installations, embassies, 13 The SNA reserves the term “imputation” for situations in which a transaction must be “constructed” as well as “valued.” See SNA 2008: 3.75. 14 A complete list of the NIPA imputations wa s previously a vaila ble in NIPA table 7.12, “Imputations in the Na tional Income a nd Product Accounts ,” which was discontinued in 2024. Previously published tables can be accessed in BEA’s Data Archive . 15 In the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA introduced improved methods for measuring the implicitly priced services provided by commercial banks (see Kyle K. Hood, “ Measuring the Services of Commercial Ba nks in the Na tional Income a nd Product Accounts: Changes in Concepts a nd Methods in the 2013 Comprehensive Revision ,” S urvey 93 (February 2013): 8 –19). In the 2018 comprehensive update, these methods were also applied to credit unions and savings institutions; see Jason W. Chute, Stephanie H. McCulla , a nd Shelly Smith, “ Preview of the 2018 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts ,” S urvey 98 (April 2018).",
  "24": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-6 and consulates abroad . This treatment aligns gross domestic product ( GDP ), the principal measure of U.S. production, with other U.S. statistics, such as population and employment. In BE A’s International Transactions A ccounts (ITAs), the U.S. territories, Puerto Rico , and the Northern Mariana Islands are also treated as part of the domestic economy. This geographic difference between the two set s of accounts is reconciled through a “territorial adjustment.”16 In the NIPAs, a distinction is made between “domestic” measures and “national” measures. Domestic measures cover activities that take place within the geographic borders of the United States , while national measures cover activities that are attributable to U.S. residents.17 Thus, domestic measures are concerned with where an activity takes place, while national measures are concerned with to whom the activity is attributed. For example, GDP measures the market value of the goods , services , and structures produced within the nation's economy in a given period, while gross national product (GNP) measures the market value of the goods , servi ces, and structures produced by labor and prope rty supplied by U.S. residents. GNP i s equal to GDP plus income r eceipts from the rest of the world less income p ayments to the re st of the world, and it is con ceptually equival ent to gross n ational income (thoug h it is est imated using different sour ce da ta). Thus, for an assembly plant that is owned by a Japanese auto company and located in the United States, all of its output is included in GDP, but only the portion of the value that reflects U.S. residents’ labor and property is included in GNP. And, for an assembly plant that is owned by a U.S. auto company and located in Great Britain, none of its output is included in GDP, but the portion of the value that reflects U.S. residents’ labor or property is included in GNP . 16 See NIPA table 4.3C. “Relation of Foreign Transactions in the National Income and Product Accounts to the Corresponding Items in the International Transactions Accounts ,” available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov . Effective with the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA includes most transactions between the U.S. government and economic agents in Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands in federal government receipts a nd expenditures. Thus, like private transactions (such as trade in goods and services), government transactions with these areas are treated as transactions with the rest of the world. BEA’s long -run goal is to make the geographic coverage in the NIPAs con sistent with that in the ITAs (see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, 10 -27). See also Christina D. Hovland -Battikha and Erin M. Ludlow, “ Territorial Economic Accounts for A merican Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, a nd the U.S. Virgin Isla nds ,” S urvey 98 (February 2018). 17 “U.S. residents” includes individuals, governments, business enterprises, trusts, associations, nonprofit institutions, and similar organizations that have the center of their economic interest in the United States and that reside or expect to reside in the United States for 1 year or more. (For example, business enterprises residing in the United States include U.S. affiliates of foreign companies.) In addition, U.S. residents include all U.S. citizens who reside outside the United States for less than 1 year and U.S. citizens residing abroad for 1 year or more who meet one of the following criteria: owners or employees of U.S. business enterprises who reside abroad to further the enterprises’ business and who intend to return withi n a reasonable period; U .S. government civilian and military employees and members of their immediate families; and students who attend foreign educational institutions.",
  "25": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-7 Income and saving Some economic theorists have broadly defined income as the maximum amount that a household, or other economic unit, can consume without reducing its net worth; saving is then defined as the actual change in net worth.18 In the NIPAs, the definition of income is narrower, reflecting the goal of measuring current production. That is, the NIPA aggregate measures of current income —gross domestic income (GDI) for example—are viewed as arising from current production, and thus they are theoretically equal to their production counterparts ( GDI equals GDP). NIPA saving is measured as the portion of current income that is set aside rather than spent on consumption or related purposes. Consequently, the NIPA measures of income and saving exclude the following items that affect net worth but are not directly associated with current production: • Capital gains or losses, or holding gains (or losses) , which reflect changes in the prices of existing assets and thus do not represent changes in the real s tock of produced assets; • Capital transfers, which reflect changes in the ownership of existing assets; and • Events, such as nat ural disasters, that result in changes in the real stock of existing assets but do not reflect an economic transaction. Thus, for example, the NIPA estimate of personal income includes ordinary dividends paid to stockholders, but it excludes the capital gains that accrue to those stockholders as a result of rising stock prices. Personal saving is equal to p ersonal income less pers onal outlays and personal taxes; i t may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences. 19 GDP and Other Major NIPA Measures Three ways to measure GDP In the NIPAs, GDP is defined as the market value of the goods , services , and structures produced by the economy in a given period. Conceptually , this measure can be arriv ed at by three separate means: as the sum of goods and services sold to final users, as the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services, and as the sum of the value added at each stage of production (figure 2.1). Although these three ways of measuring GDP are conceptually the same, their calculation may not result in identical estimates of GDP because of differences in data sources, timing, and estimation techniques . 18 Other theorists have limited this definition to expected income, a definition that would include regular capital gains but would exclude an unexpected windfall, such as a jackpot lottery payoff. 19 See “ Alternative Measures of Personal Saving ,” Survey 92 (March 2012): 23 –26.",
  "26": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-8 1. As the sum of goods and services sold to final users This measure, known as the expenditures approach, is used to identify the goods and services purchased by persons, businesses, governments, and foreigners. It is calculated by summing the following final expenditures components. • Personal consumption expenditures , which measures the value of the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, persons —that is, households, nonprofit institutions that primarily serve households, private noninsured welfare funds, and private trust funds. • Gross private fixed investment , which measures additions and replacements to the stock of private fixed assets without deduction of depreciation. Nonresidential fixed investment measures investment by businesses and nonprofit institutions in nonresidential structures , equipment , and intellectual property products . Residential fixed investment measures investment by businesses and households in residential structures and equipment, primarily new construction of single - family and multifamily units. • Change in private inventories , which measures the value of the change in the physical volume of inventories owned by private business over a specified period, valued in the average prices of that period . • Net exports of goods and services , which is calculated as exports less imports. Exports consist of goods and services that are sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by U.S. residents to foreign residents. Imports consist of goods and services that are sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by foreign residents to U.S. residents. • Government consumption expenditures and gross investment , which comprises two components. Current consumption expenditures consists of the spending by general government in order to produce and provide goods and services to the public. Gross investment consists of spending by both general government and government enterprises for fixed assets (structures, equipment, and intellectual property products) that benefit the public or that assist government agencies in their productive activities.",
  "27": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-9 Thus, GDP is equal to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) plus gross private domestic fixed investment plus change in private inventories plus government consumption expenditures and gross investment plus exports minus imports. In this calculation , imports offset the non-U.S. production that is included in the other final - expenditure components . For example, PCE includes expenditures on imported cars as well as on domestically produced cars ; thus, in order to properly measure domestic production, the sales of foreign -produced cars that are included in PCE are offset by a comparable entry in the imports of these cars .20 2. As the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services 20 The offset covers the foreign -produced portion of the value of these sales; the domestic value -added (such as the margin provided by domestic dealerships) on imported cars is measured by the difference between the two and is included in GDP.

  "28": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-10 This measure , known as the income approach, is used to examine the purchasing power of households and the financial status of business es. The aggregate measure, referred to as GDI , is derived by summing the following components . • Compensation of employees , which is the total remuneration of employees in return for their work. It consists of w ages and salaries (primarily the monetary remuneration of employees ) and s upplements (employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance ). • Taxes on production and imports , which consist of taxes payable on products when they are produced, delivered, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by their producers (including f ederal excise taxes , custom duties, and state and local sales taxes) and of other taxes on production, such as taxes on ownership of assets used in production (including local real estate taxes). These taxes do not include taxes on income. • Subsidies , which are subtracted in the calculation of GDI, are payments by government agencies to private business (for example, federal subsidies to farmers) and to government enterprises (for example, f ederal subsidies to state and local public housing authorities ) to support their current operations . • Net operating surplus , which is a profits -like measure that shows the incomes earned by private and government enterprise s from current production before deducting any explicit or implicit interest charges, rent, or other property incomes payable on financial assets, land, or other natural resources required to carry out production. Net operating surplus plus consumption of fixed capital is equal to gross operating surplus . • Consumption of fixed capital , which is the NIPA measure of economic depreciation —that is, the decline in the value of the stock of assets due to physical deterioration , normal obsolescence, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event . 21 Thus, GDI is equal to compensation of employees, plus taxes on production and imports less subsidies, plus net operating surplus, plus consumption of fixed capital. Subsidies are implicitly included in the measure of net operating surplus , but because they do not represent incomes paid or costs incurred in domestic production, they must be subtracted in calculating GDI. In the NIPAs, subsidies are shown as a subtract ion from “taxes on imports and production” because they are transfers from government to business and thus, in effect , represent a negative tax by government. 3. As t he sum of “value added” by all industries in the economy This measure, known as the value -adde d, or production, approach, is used to analyze the industrial composition of U.S. output. In the input -output (I -O) accounts, value added is defined as the difference between an industry’ s gross output (sales or 21 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of disasters in which the value of irreparable damage to, or the destruction of, fixed assets is no longer recorded as consumption of fixed capital; see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, 10 -27.",
  "29": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-11 receipts plus other operating income and inventory change) and its intermediate inputs (goods and services that are use d in production) . When value added is aggregated across all industries in the economy, it is equal to GDP measured using the expenditures and income approaches .22 The I -O accounts focus on gross output because they are designed to measure the productive activities and interrelationships of all industries, regardless of whether the goods and services produced by these industries are for intermediate or for final use. Thus, gross output is sometimes referred to as “gross duplicated domestic output,” because it double counts the industry output that is purchased by other industries and used as inputs for their production. Because GDP counts only industry sales to final users, it is sometimes referred to as a “nonduplicative” measure of production in the economy. To illustrate , a new car shipped from an auto assembly plant reflects not only the costs and profit associated with final assembly but also the costs and profit associated with all of the stages of production that preceded final assembly. At an earlier stage, the tires that were put on that car were recorded as output of the tire plant and reflected the costs and profit associated with their manufacture. Thus, in gross output, the value of the tires is counted tw ice—once in the value of the auto manufacturer’s output and once i n the value of the tire manufacturer’s output . Further, including the value of the rubber and metal that were shipped to th e tire plant would constitute triple counting, and so on. In contrast, in the measurement of auto-industry value added, the value of the tires shipped to the assembly plant represents an intermediate input and so is subtracted from the value of the shipments of completed cars from the assembly plant. Because the n ation’s total value added is equal to its GDP and t he nation’s total gross output is equal to its GDP plus its total intermediate inputs , total gross output is much larger than GDP. For example, in the 2017 benchmark year, U.S. gross output was $34.5 trillion, while GDP was $ 19.6 trillion. Major NIPA a ggregates In the NIPAs, the measure of domestic production that is derived as the sum of the final expenditure s components is referred to as GDP , and the measure that is derived as the sum of the income payments and the costs incurred in production is referred to as GDI. These two measures and their components make up the “Domestic Income and Product Account, ” the first of the summary NIPA accounts ( see the section “Accounting Framework” ). In general, the source data for the expenditures components are considered 22 In the I -O accounts, “all industries” includes government industries (such as the U. S. Postal Service) and certain “special industries” (such as owner -occupied housing).",

Figure 2.2 illustrates the relationships between GDP, GDI, and several other important aggregate NIPA measures. These measures are distinguished by whether they are “product” or “ income,” “gross ” or “ net,” and “domestic” or “national.” In general, one moves : • from a “product” measure to an “income” measure by subtract ing the statistical discrepancy, • from a “gross ” measure to a “net” measure by subtracting consumption of fixed capital (CFC), and • from a “domestic” measure to a “national” measure by subtracting net income paymen ts to the rest of the world (or equivalently, by adding net income receipts from the rest of the world). 25 23 See Dylan G. Rassier, “The Role of Profits and Income in the Statistical Discrepancy ,” Survey 92 (February 2012): 8 –22. 24 The average of GDP and GDI was introduced as part of the 2015 annual update of the NIPAs.

Source data are not available to distinguish the portion of imported goods that flows into inventories from the portion that is sold directly, so the measure does not, strictly speaking, identify the sales from domestic product.",
  "33": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-15 more persistent movements in spending by consumers and businesses in the United States.29 Principal quantity and price measures The market values and imputations used to measure GDP and the other NIPA estimates are in current dollars —that is, they re flect transactions in terms of their value in the periods in which they take place. Although many technical problems arise in preparing these estimates, measuring the change in current -dollar GDP from one period to the next is conceptually straightforward, because it is the actual change in spending that occurs in the economy between the two time periods. For many analyses, it is useful to separate the changes in current -dollar GDP that are due to changes in quantity from those that are due to changes in price. 30 However, aggregate quantity change and aggregate price change cannot be observed directly in the economy. Instead, these changes must be calculated, and the calculation method is determined by analytic requirements. In the NIPAs, the changes in quantities and prices are computed from chain -type indexes that are calculated using a Fisher formula. (For a discussion of the statistical methods used to prepare these measures , see “ Chapter 4: Estimating Methods .”) In the NIPAs, the featured measure of growth in the U.S. economy is the percent change in real GDP —that is, the quantity-change measure for GDP from one period to another. 31 Thus, changes in real GDP provide a comprehensive measure of economic growth that is free of the effects of price change. In the NIPAs, the featured measure of inflation in the U.S. economy is the p ercent change in the price index for gross domestic purchases. This index measures the prices of goods and services purchased by U.S. residents, regardless of where the go ods and services were produced. It is derived from the prices of PCE , gross private domestic investment , and government consumption expenditures and gross investment . Thus, for example, an increase in the import price of a foreign -produced car would raise the prices paid by U.S. residents and thereby direct ly affect the price index for gross domestic purchases.32 29 This mea sure wa s introduced a s part of the 2015 annual update of the NIPAs; see Stephanie McCulla and Shelly Smith, “ Preview of the 2015 Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts ,” Survey 95 (June 2015): 1 -8. 30 In this separation, changes in the quality of the goods and services provided are treated as changes in qua ntity; BEA uses quality -adjusted price indexes to deflate goods and services to yield quantity estimates; these indexes are described in the appendix to Chapter 4: Estimating Methods . 31 Until 1991, GNP was the featured measure of U.S. production; see “ Gross Domestic Product as a Measure of U.S. Production ,” S urvey 71 (August 1991): 8. 32 This example assumes the entire price increase is passed on to the car buyer —that is, the wholesale or retail margins are unchanged.",
  "34": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-16 Another aggregate price measure is the GDP price index, which measures the prices of goods and services produced in the United States . In contrast to the price index for gross domestic purchases, t he GDP price index would not be directly affected by an increas e in the import price of a foreign -built car, because imports are not included in GDP . Another important NIPA price measure is the PCE price index , which measures the prices paid for the goods and services purchased by “ persons .” This index is frequently compared with the consumer price index, which is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . The two indexes are similar, but there are differences in terms of coverage, weighting, and calculation.33 Further , BEA provides variants of the above price indexes that exclud e their particularly volatile food and energy components; for the PCE price index, there are also variant s that also exclude housing . 34 These var iants are sometimes used to indicate the “core inflation ” in the U.S. economy. BEA publishes several aggregate measures of real income as counterparts to its aggregate measures of real production. Real GDI is calculated as current -dollar GDI deflated by the implicit price deflator (IPD) for GDP; re al GNI is calculated as current - dollar GNI deflated by the IPD for GNP; and real net domestic income is calculated as current-dollar net domestic income deflated by the IPD for net domestic product.35 In addition, BEA prepares alternative measures of real GDP and real GNP that measure the real purchasing power of the income generated from the production of the goods and services by the U.S. economy. These measures, which in the NIPAs are called command-basis GDP and command-basis GNP , reflect the impact of changes in the terms of trade as well as changes in production (BEA also prepares alternative command - basis measures of NNP and NDP) . 36 In calculating command -basis GDP, exports and imports of goods and services are each deflated by the price index for gross domestic purchases to yield exports on a command-basis and imports on a command basis; then, command -basis exports are added to, and command-basis imports are subtracted from, real gross domestic purchases. 37 The calculation of command -basis GNP is the same, except income receipts from the rest of the world are deflated along with exports, and 33 See Clinton P. McCully, Brian C. Moyer, and Kenneth J. Stewart, “ Comparing the Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index ,” S urvey 87 (November 2007): 26 –33. 34 Price indexes for PCE excluding food, energy, and housing and for PCE services excluding energy and housing were introduced as part of the 2023 comprehensive update of the National Economic Accounts. See Lisa S. Ma taloni, Doria n L. Turner, a nd Stephanie H. McCull a, “The 2023 Comprehensive Update of the National Economic Accounts ,” S urvey 103 ( November 2023). 35 Implicit price deflators for an aggregate or component are calculated as the ratio of the current -dolla r value to the corresponding chained -dollar value, multiplied by 100 (see the section “Chained -dolla r measures” in Chapter 4). 36 In the SNA, these measures are referred to as real GDI and real GNI. However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, BEA uses a different method to derive those aggregates. 37 In this case, adding and subtracting these estimates is acceptable because all three aggregates are derived using the same deflator.",
  "35": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-17 income payments to the rest of the world are deflated along with imports.38 In effect, the calculations are the same as deriving command -basis GDP (GNP) by deflating current - dollar GDP (GNP) by the price index for gross domestic purchases. Thus, the command- basis measures are alternative measures of real GDP and real GNP that ref lect the prices of purchased goods and services, while the primary measures of real GDP and real GNP reflect the prices of produced goods and services. BEA also prepares several measures that show the relationship between the prices that are received by U.S. producers and the prices that are paid by U.S. purchasers. The broadest measure, the trading gains index , is the ratio of the GDP price index to the price index for gross domestic purchases. An increase (decrease) in this ratio would indicate an increase (decrease) in the purchasing power of the income generated in producing GDP. Successively narrower measur es specifically focus on the relationship between the prices of the U.S. goods and services that are produced for consumption by the rest of the world and the prices of the goods and services that are produced by the rest of the world for U.S. consumption. The terms of trade index , is the ratio of the price index for exports of goods and services to the price index for imports of goods and services; ratios for the terms of trade in goods and in nonpetroleum goods are also prepared. Movements in these trading indexes reflect the int eraction of several factors —including movements in exchange rates, changes in the composition of traded goods and services, and changes in producers’ profit margins. In addition, BEA provides statistical measures that supplement the current -dollar, quantity -index, and price -index measures. Foremost among these are measures of the contributions of major components to the percent change from the preceding year or quarter in real GDP, in other principal product -side aggregates, in GDP prices, and in gross domestic purchases prices. BEA also provides measures of the percentage shares of current-dollar GDP and GDI that are accounted for by their major components. Classification The application of common classification system s for the NIPAs, and for all of the U.S. economic accounts, is extremely important because classification provide s the structure necessary to prepare and present the estimates uniformly and consistently. Further, common classifications enable users to effectively compare and analyze data across the broad spectrum of economic statistics. 38 This methodology for calculating the command -basis aggregates was introduced in the 2010 annual update of the NIPAs; see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, “ Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts ,” S urvey 90 (August 2010): 21. For additional technical and historical background, see Marshall B.

  "36": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-18 In the NIPAs, the estimates of production and expenditures may be classified by sector , by type of product , and by function, while the estimates of income may be classified by industry and by legal form of organization. Sector The NIPAs have a “mixed” sectoring scheme under which certain entities are defined one way for production related measures and another way for income -related measures 39. For measuring domestic production in the NIPAs, the contribution, or value added, of various institutions can be broken down into three distinct groups, or sectors — business, households and institutions, and general government (table 2.1). A fourth sector, referred to as “the rest -of-the-world,” covers transactions between U. S. residents and foreign residents. Table 2.1 —Gross Value Added by Sector Gross domestic product Business Nonfarm Farm Households and institutions Households Nonprofit institutions serving households General government Federal State and loca l Note. Adapted f rom NIPA table 1.3.1. Business: The business sector comprises all corporate and noncorporate businesses that are organized for profit, other entities that produce goods and services for sale at a price that is based on the costs of production, and certain other entities that are treated as business es in the NIPAs. These other entities include mutual financial institutions, noninsured pension funds, cooperatives, nonprofit organizations (that is, entities classified as nonprofit by the Internal Revenue Service in determining inco me tax liability) that prim arily serve business, federal reserve banks, federally sponsored credit agencies, and government enterprises. The g ross value added of the business sector is measured as GDP les s the gross value added of households and institutions and of general government. 40 39 For additional detail on the mixed sectoring scheme of the NIPAs, see Stephanie H.

They are calculated based on the costs incurred and the incomes earned from production.",
  "37": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-19 Households and institutions : The households and institutions sector comprises households (families and unrelated individuals) and nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISHs). The gross value added of households is measured by the services of owner -occupied housing and the compensation paid to domestic workers. The gross value added of NPISHs is measured by the compensation paid to the employees of these institutions, the rental value of fixed assets owned and used by these institutions, and the renta l income of persons for tenant -occupied housing owned by these institutions. 41 General governmen t: The general government sector comprises all federal government and state and local government agencies except government enterprises. The gross value added of general government is measured as the sum of the compensation of the employees of these agencies and of their consumption of fixed capital . For measuring domestic income, outlays, and saving, institutions are grouped into three other sectors —personal, government, and corporate (along with the fourth “rest of world” sector for limited measures of transactions in income). Personal : The personal sector comprises households (families and unrelated individuals) and private unincorporated enterprises —that is, sole proprietorships, partnerships, and other private businesses, such as tax-exempt cooperatives. 42 Government : The government sector comprises both general government and government agencies; while the production of the enterprises is included in the business sector, their surplus or deficit as well as their interest payments and receipts and their investments ar e included in the government sector. Estimates of most transactions between government enterprises and their general government owners are not provided. Corporate : The corporate sector comprises only corporate businesses that are organized for profit; government enterprises and unincorporated businesses are classified in the household sector and government sector, respectively.

Industry The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the official industry classification system for the United States . 48 NAICS was developed during the 1990s through a collaborative effort by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to facilitate better comparisons of the economies of the three countries.49 Prior to the adoption of NAICS, most U.S. statistics were based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).50 The SIC system, which was initially developed in the late 1930s, was concentrated in manufacturing, which dominated the U.S. economy at that time. The switch from the SIC to NAICS provided more detailed classifications for services industries and for high-tech industries. Moreover, by organizing establishments based on their production methods rather than on the products they produced, NAICS provided a better conceptual basis for industrial classification. NAICS was introduced into the national economic accounts in late 2002 with the release of the 1997 benchmark I -O accounts, which were based on the 1997 Economic Census. Effective with the 2003 comprehensive update , NAICS became the industry classification system for the NIPAs. In the NIPAs, i ndustrial distributions are presented for national income and most of its components, capital consumption allowances, employment and hours, and the change in private inventories and the stock of private inventories (see, for example, table 2.5 below) . 51 For income and employment , the classification of the estimates for 1998 forward is based on N AICS; for inventories, th e classification of the estimates for the first quarter of 1997 forward is based on NAICS. In general, the estimates by industry before these dates are on a SIC basis .52 48 See North American Industry Classification System, United States , available on the Census Bureau website at www.census. gov/naics/ . 49 For information of the development and implementation of NAICS, see John Kort, “ The North Am erican Industry Classification System in BEA’s Accounts ,” S urvey 81 (May 2001): 7 –13. 50 See Office of Ma nagement a nd Budget, Statistical Policy Division, Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), 1988); Office of Management a nd Budget, Sta tistical Policy Division, Standard Industrial Classification Manual,1972 (Wa shington, DC: GPO, 1972); and Bureau of the Budget, Standard Industrial Classification Manual,1942 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1942). 51 An industrial distribution of fixed investment based on data collected from establishments is prepared as part of the procedure used to estimate fixed assets. For further information, see “Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, for 1925 –97,” September 2007 on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 52 NAICS -based estimates for GDP by industry and for fixed assets are available for earlier periods.",
  "41": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-23 Industrial distributions of government activities are not provided; instead, they are combined into a single category. For most series, separate estimates are s hown for the activities of the federal g overnment, of state and local governments, and of government enterprises.

Adapted from NIPA table 6.1D . The industrial distributions for wages and salaries and for inventories are generally based on data collected from “establishments ,” while those for the other NIPA components are generally based on data collected from “companies” (also called “enterprises, ” or “firms ”). Companies consist of one or more establishments owned by the same legal entity or group of affiliated entities. Establishments are economic units, generally at a single physical location, where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed (for example a factory, mill, store, hotel, movie theater, mine, farm, airline terminal, sales office, warehouse, or central administrative office) . Establishments are classified into an industry on the basis of their principal production method, and companies are classified into an industry on the basis of the principal industry of all their establishments. Because large multi-establishment companies typically contain establishments that are classified in different industries, the industrial distribution of the same economic activity on an establishment basis can differ significantly from that on a company basis. For example, the measure of corporate profits by steel-manufacturing companies will include the profits of establishments that do not manufacture steel but are part of companies that are classified as steel -manufacturing",
  "42": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-24 companies. Similarly, this measure will exclude the profits of establishments tha t manufacture steel but are part of companies that are not classified as steel -manufacturing companies. Moreover, individual industry series are not fully comparable over time. First, the composition of industries may change because of revision s to NAICS or to the SIC. This factor affects estimates based on establishment data and on company data. Second, historical comparability may be affected by a change over time in the industrial classification of the same establishment or company. For example, t he classification of a company may change as a result of s hifts in the level of consolidation of entities for which company reports are filed or as a result of mergers and acquisitions . This factor affects company -based estimates much more than establishment -based estimates. As noted above, there is a break in 1998 between SIC and NAICS classifications for NIPA estimates of income and employment and in 1997 for NIPA estimates of inventories. Moreover, while the NAICS -based NIPA estimates are periodically updated to reflect the most recent NAICS categories (currently 2012), the estimates are bridged to, and largely presented on, the 1997 NAICS structure to avoid repeated changes to the NIPA presentation. In addition, some NIPA tables show the following special industry groupings: Financial industries consists of the NAICS industry “Finance and insurance” and of “Offices of bank holding companies” and “Offices of other holding companies ” in the NAICS industry “M anagement of companies and enterprises.” Fin ance and insurance consists of Federal Reserve banks; credit intermediation and related activities; securities, commodity contracts, and investments; insurance carriers and related activities; and funds , trusts, and other financial vehicles.

  "44": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-26 Accounting Framework The NIPAs consist of a set of integrated accounts that provide statistics on the output of the U.S. economy. The NIPA accounting framework is designed to provide context for these statistics, so that they are presented logically, consistently, and according to established economic -accounting principles and sta ndards. The NIPAs are generally consistent with the SNA , which now serves as the internationally accepted set of guidelines for the compilation of national accounts . 53 For a n in-depth discussion of the conceptual framework of the NIPAs and the NIPA summary accounts and of the underlying accounting principles and common financial statements , see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, An Introduction to the National Income and Product Accounts , Methodology Paper No. 1 (updated), September 2007.54 The seven summary accounts and the definitions of the line items th ey include at make up the seven summary accounts are presented in the appendix to this Handbook, “Summary National Income and Product Accounts.” Accounting principles Double -entry bookkeeping is one of the most fundamental principle s used in economic accounting and in financial accounting. In financial accounting , activities that affect the resources available to a business are recorded at least once as a source of financing (credit) and at least once as a u se of financing (debit). Thus, double -entry bookkeeping provides a means to validate the accounting entries, because the sum of the entries on each side of an account must be equal. In national economic accounting, each transactio n is recorded as a payment by one sector and a s a receipt by the same sector or by another sector —for example corporate income tax is a payment by a corporation and a receipt of the government. 55 In addition to providing a means to validate entries, this system also provides alternative ways to calculate a measure when complete information is not available for one of the sectors. The accrual -accounting method is another principle important to both financial and economic accounting. This method is generally used to ensure that related revenues and expenses are recorded in the same accounting period. In accrual accounting, revenues are recorded when the y are earned , and expenses are recorded when the y are incurred, 53 See Stephanie H. McCulla , Ka rin E. Moses, a nd Brent R. Moulton, “ The National Income and Product Accounts and the System of National Accounts 2008: Comparison and Research Plans ,” S urvey 95 (June 2015): 1 -17, and see Charles Ian Mead, Karin E. Moses, and Brent R. Moulton, “ The NIPAs and the System of National Accounts ,” S urvey 84 (December 2004): 17 –32. 54 “An Introduction to the National Income and Product Accounts ,” avai l abl e at www.bea.gov . 55 A fully articulated set of national accounts (showing payments and receipts by all sectors) actually leads to a qua druple -entry system (in which each transaction is recorded as a debit and a change in assets for one sector and as a credit and a change in assets for another sector). However, transactions are usually recorded only twice in the NIPAs because the changes in assets or liabilities that are associated with the changes in revenues or expenses are recorded in the Federal Reserve Board’s flow of funds accounts.",
  "45": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-27 regardless of when the cash is actually received or paid. The accrual -accounting method may be contrasted to the cash -accounting method, which records revenues when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. Financial accounting and economic accounting generally apply diff erent principles in valuing transactions. In financial accounting, assets (and depreciation) are commonly valued at historical costs —that is, at the prices relevant at the time of the acquisition; subsequent changes in the value of these assets are ignored. In economic accounting, assets (and depreciation) are valued at current costs —that is, at the market prices that prevail at the time they are valued . In preparing the NIPAs, various adjustm ents, such as the inventory valuation adjustment and the capital consumption adjustment , are made so that the estimates will reflect current costs rather than historical costs. Conceptual derivation of the NIPAs The NIPAs represent consolidations of the production, the income and outlay, and the saving and investment accounts for each sector of the economy (business, households, government, and foreign). These sector accounts, i n turn, represent aggregations of the accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy, regardless of whether formal accounting statements exist explicitly for all of them. Specifically, for each sector, the production account records the value of the production that is attributable to that sector and the uses of the income arising from that production. The income and outlay account records the sources of the sector’s income, its current outlays, and its saving. The saving and investment account (also known as the capital account) records the sector’s gross saving and gross investment, where gross investment is net acquisitions of assets less net increase in liabilities. Figure 2.3 illustrates the relationship between the summary NIPAs and the underlying production, income and outlay, and saving and investment accounts for the sectors of the economy.",
  "46": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-28 The NIPA summary “domestic income and product account” represents a consolidation of the production accounts for business, households and institutions, and general government . The income and outlay accounts for the sectors are shown in three separate summary accounts. Income and outlays for the personal sector, including income accruing to unincorporated businesses, are shown in the “personal income and outlay account.” Income and outlays for the government sector, including income accruing to government enterprises, are shown in the “government current receipts and expenditures account. Income and outlays for business enterprises and for households and institutions in their role as producers are shown in the “private enterprise income account.” In order to provide analytically useful aggregates associated with all private business, the coverage in this account include s the income and outlays of unincorporated businesses as well as th ose of corporate business es. The saving and investment accounts are consolidated into a single summary “domestic capital account.” For saving, a breakdown by sector is shown for corporate, personal, and government saving. For investment, because of source data limitations, the breakdown is shown for private fixed and inventory investment and for government fi xed investment. The transactions for the foreign (or rest -of-the-world) “sector ”—that is, transactions between U.S. residents and foreign residents —are shown separately in two summary accounts. Current receipts and expenditures, such as exports and imports of goods a nd services, are shown in the “f oreign transactions current account,” and capital transactions, such as capital transfers, are shown in the “f oreign transactions capital account.” Production Income and outlay Saving and investment Figure 2.3.

  "47": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-29 The summary NIPAs The seven summary NIPAs constitute the accounting framework for presenting the value of production, distribution, consumption, and saving for the U.S. economy. 56 (For definitions of all of the line entries in these tables , and to see the tables themselves , see the appendix to this handbook. ) Each of the entries in a summary account also appears again in that account or in one of the other summary accounts ; most of these entries are also shown in one or more of the tables that make up the full set of NIPA tables. For example, the item “supplements to wages and salaries” is shown in line 5 of summary account 1 and in line 14 of summary account 3; it is also shown in line 8 of NIPA table 1.10 and in line 6 of NIPA table 2.1. Taken together, the summary accounts constitute a double -entry system in which a use (or expenditure) recorded in one account for one sector is also recorded as a source (or receipt) in an account of another sector or of the same sector. This system of integrated, double -entry accounts provides a comprehensive measure of economic activity in a consistently defined framework without double -counting. Thus, the NIPAs, in combination with BEA’s industry, wealth, and other economic accounts, can be used to trace the principal economic flows among the major sectors of the economy. Account 1: Domestic Income and Product Account This account represents an aggregation of the underlying production accounts for the domestic sectors of the U.S. economy. The right (product) side of the account shows GDP measured as the sum of goods and services sold to final users rather than as the sum of value -added by the sectors. The left (income) side of the account shows GDP as measured by the incomes earned in production—GDI —plus the “statistical discrepancy” (the difference between GDP and GDI). Product and income are both presented on a domesti c basis —that is, they are produced by labor and property located in the United States. Account 2: Private Enterprise Income Account This account presents information on the sources and uses of the income of private businesses and other private enterprises.57 It combines the accounts of private businesses, o f homeowners for owner -occupied housing (which is treated as if it were a business) , and of NPISHs . 56 Prior to the 2003 comprehensive update , the NIPAs were summarized in five accounts, as shown in Ta ble A on pages 38 –39 of the August 2002 Survey . For a discussion of the differences between the old and new summary accounts, see Nicole Mayerhauser, Shelly Smith, and David F. Sullivan, “ Preview of the 2003 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: New and Redesigned Ta bles ,” S urvey 83 (August 2003): 8 –15. 57 Government enterprises are not included in account 2, because complete estimates on sources and uses of government enterprise income, notably the income payments and income receipts on assets, are not currently available. The sources and uses of government enterprise income are included, but not separately identified, in the government receipts and expenditures account.",
  "48": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-30 Sources of private enterprise income—such as income receipts on assets and net operating surplus —are shown on the right side of the account.58 The left side of the account shows the uses of income as income payments on assets (such as holders of financial liabilities and equity claims of other businesses), business current transfer payments, and income that accrues to the owners of business (namely proprietors’ income, rental income of persons, and corporate profits ). Corporate profits, a widely used measure in the United States, is distributed to government (taxes on corporate income) and to shareholders (net dividends) or is retained (undistributed profits , which can be thought of as a measure of corporate saving). Account 3: Personal Income and Outlay Account This account shows the sources and uses of income received by persons —that is, households , NPISHs, private noninsured welfare funds, and private trust funds. The right side of the account shows the sources of personal income —such as employee compensation and interest and dividend income. The left side shows personal taxes and outlays and personal saving , which is derived as personal income minus personal taxes and outlays. Account 4: Government Receipts and Expenditures Account This account summarizes the combined transactions of the f ederal government and of the state and local governments. The right side of the account shows government current receipts —such as tax receipts from persons and contributions for government social insurance. The left side shows government current expenditures —such as compensation of government employees and transfer payments to persons —and net saving , which is derived as current receipts less current expenditures. Account 5: Foreign Transactions Current Account This account summarizes all the current transactions between the United States and the rest of the world. It presents information on receipts and payments associated with foreign trade , income receipts and payments, and current taxes and other transfer payments . This account does not include transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of nonproduced nonfinancial assets nor capital transfers, which are shown in the foreign transactions capital account, nor does it include transactions in financial ass ets and liabilities. The left side of th is account shows current receipts from the rest of the world —mainly exports of goods and services , income receipts on assets, and current taxes, contributions for government social insurance, and transfer receipts from the rest of the world . The right side shows current payments to the rest of the world—mainly imports of goods and services , income payments on assets , and current taxes and transfer 58 Summary account 2 presents the components of private enterpr ise income on a national basis —that is , for income accruing to U.S. residents. Consequently, for the net operating surplus to be shown in account 2 on a domestic basis consistent with summary account 1, several components showing income flows to and from the rest of the world are added to account 2.",
  "49": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-31 payments to the rest of the world . In addition, it includes the balance on current account , which is derived as current receipts less current payments. Account 6: Domestic Capital Account This account presents information on saving and investment for the economy. The right side of the account shows gross saving and the statistical discrepancy. Given the theoretical equality between GDP and GDI, the statistical discrepancy can be viewed as actual (positive or negative) income that is not captured by the data used to measure GDI and, therefore, not distributed to the sectors; instead, it is shown as a source of (positive or negative) saving in this account. The left side of the account shows gross domestic investment, capital-account transactions (net) , and net lending or net borrowing , which is derived as gross saving and the statistical discrepancy minus gross domestic investment and capital -account transactions (net) . Account 7: Foreign Transactions Capital Account This account presents information on transactions between the United States and the rest of the world that involve the acquisition or disposition of nonproduced nonfinancial assets and capital transfers . The left side of the account shows the balance on current account. The right side shows capital-account transactions (net) and net lending or borrowing , which is derived as the balance on current account minus capital - account transactions (net) .",
  "50": "3-1 CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA (Updated: May 2019) Source data as determinants of initial release and revision schedules Source data for the current quarterly estimates Source data for the annual updates Source data for the comprehensive updates Source data are the information BEA uses to prepare the NIPA estimates, and estimating methods are the steps BEA takes to transform the source data into these estimates . The interaction of source data and estimating methods determi nes the accuracy , reliability , and relevancy of the accounts. The data that BEA uses are collected from a variety of sources and are usually collected for purposes other than for incorporation into BEA's estimates. Data collected by federal government agencies provide the backbone of the estimates; these data are supplemented by data from trade associations, businesses, international organizations, and other sources. The Government data are from a n umber of agencies, including the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Treasury Department, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Agriculture Department. “Administrative” data are data that are tabulated by federal government and by state and local government agencies as a byproduct of administering their programs—such as processing corporate tax returns, regulating public utilities, and issuing building permits. Examples of important admini strative sources of data for the NIPAs include the Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income program, which provides data for a number of NIPA income estimates , the Budget of the United States Government from the Executive Office of the President, which is the major source of data for the NIPA estimates of federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment , the social insurance programs of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Social Security Administration, which provide data on health insurance and social security incomes, and the military payroll systems of the U.S. Department of Defense. “Statistical” data are data collected by the federal statistical agencies, such as the Census Bureau and BLS. These data consist of periodic economic and population censuses and a wide range of sample surveys, such as those that collect data on manufacturing and trade, employment, and prices . The relatively few surveys that BEA conducts cover international trade in services and internat ional direct investment, both by foreign companies in the United States and by U.S. companies in foreign countries. The source data available to BEA are not always ideal f or the p reparation of the NIPAs . BEA must develop methods that transform the best available data into estimates that are consistent with the NIPA concepts and framework and that fill gaps in the coverage of the source data. (See “ Chapter 4 : Estimating Methods .”)",
  "51": "CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA 3-2 Source data as determinants of initial release and revision schedules The availability of the source data is an important consideration in determin ing the schedules for the initial release and the subsequent revisions of the NIPA estimates. One factor affecting availability is the speed with which the source data are collected, compiled, and released . Another factor is whether the source data are part o f a statistical program that, over time, provides more complete or otherwise better coverage —for example, if the sample is larger or if more detailed information is collected for an annual survey than for the monthly surveys . In general, the most compre hensive source data for the expenditure components of gross domestic product ( GDP ) are available at the 5 -year intervals associated with the Census Bureau’s E conomic C ensus. The E conomic C ensus is the most extensive collection of data related to business e stablishments and is the primary data source for BEA’s Input-Output A ccounts, which are used to \"benchmark\" the NIPA estimates for the quinquennial census years . Related annual surveys are drawn from s amples of the establishments c overed in the E conomic C ensus ; these surveys generally collect less detailed data than those collected in the E conomic Census . Many of the annual surveys are supplement ed by monthly surveys that involve smaller samples and that collect less detailed data t han the annual surveys . 1 In addition, responding to the censuses and annual surveys is generally mandatory, while responding to most of the quarterly and monthly surveys is voluntary. The data from the monthly surveys are available first , and they provi de much of the information that is used to pr epare the initial, or “current,” quarterly (and for a few components , monthly) NIPA estimates. These estimates are subsequently revised as additional reports become available from the monthly s urveys . Annual upd ates, which are timed to incorporate newly available annual source data, are usually carried out each fall . Comprehensive update s, which incorporate the most complete source data as well as other improvements to the accounts, are carried out at about 5- year intervals. 2 Thus, r evisions do not reflect errors. On the contrary, revisions are mainly driven by the incorporation of more complete and revised source data, and the release of the revised estimates is determined by the availability of these data . The s ource data used to prepare 1 Many of the annual and monthly surveys are based on “probability sampling” (sometimes known as “scientific sampling”). In this process, establishments are first placed into various “strata” on the basis of their size. Depending on the distribution of esta blishments, an establishment in the largest strata could have a 100- percent probability of selection and thus have a sampling weight of 1—that is, the establishment would represent only itself. An establishment in a smaller stratum would have a smaller pro bability of selection, say 1 percent, but in that case the establishment would have a sampling weight of 100—that is, the sampled establishment would represent 100 establishments. 2 Unless noted otherwise, annual data are presented on a calendar -year basis (i.e., covering January through December). Quarter data are also presented on a calendar basis (i.e., the first quarter (Q1) covers January, February, and March; Q2 covers April, May, and June; Q3 covers July, August, and September; and Q4 covers October, November, and December).",
  "52": "CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA 3-3 the estimates of GDP and gross domestic income ( GDI) can be grouped into five general categories based on their quality, availability , and use.3 • Comprehensive data provide comprehensive or nearly comprehensive coverage of the relevant population. They are either consistent with the concepts, coverage, or timing underlying the national accounts, or they can be made consistent with only minor adjustments . • Adjusted comprehensive data provide comprehensive or nearly compre hensive coverage of the relevant population; however, these data require substantial adjustments in order to conform to the concepts underlying the national accounts. • Direct indicator data are used to indicate the movements of a series rather than the levels of a series; they are closely related to the comprehensive data that are ultimately incorporated into the estimates , but they are less detailed or do not provide comprehensive coverage of the relevant population. • Indirect indicator data are used to pre pare indicator series when more suitable data are not available. They include volume or activity indicators and other NIPA estimates. • Trend -based data are used when no data are available; they are typically based on previous estimates , using moving averages, regressions, growth factors, or judgment. The following sections describe the most important federal g overnment source data that are used for the current quarterly estimates and for the annual and comprehensive updates of the NIPAs. In the preparation of the estimates , these sources are augmented by a wealth of information from other public sources and from private sources, such as trade association s. Source data for the current quarterly estimates Data from Census Bureau monthly surveys are among the primary sources for t he current quarterly estimates (table 3.1). For the most part, the samples for these voluntary surveys are drawn from the Econ omic Census, from the corresponding annual surveys, and from the Business Register; the samples are updated periodically to account for new businesses (“births”) and for businesses that discontinue operations (“deaths”). 4 3 For more information, see Alyssa E. Holdren, “ Gross Domestic Product and Gross Domestic Income : Revisions and Source Data ,” S urvey of Current Business 94 (June 2014 ): 1–11. 4 The Business Register is a comprehensive database of U.S. business establishments and companies that is maintained by the Census Bureau for s tatistical program use.

Monthly construction spending (value put- in-place) is a Census Bureau measure of the value of construction installed or erected during a given period. The data for private nonresidential buildings, for government structures, and for multi family residential buildings are derived from data collected by sampling the owners of construction projects. 7 The data for single- family residential buildings are derived indirectly using information collected in a series of sample surveys that track the number of housing- unit permits, starts, sales, and completions. The data for “other construction” are derived from a variety of sources covering farm, utility, communication, and railroad structures. These source data are primarily used in estimating private and government investment in structures. The data for construction put- in-place are released about 1 month after the close of the reference month. Monthly U.S. international trade in goods and services consist of Census Bureau estimates of trade in goods and BEA estimates of trade in services.

The BEA estimates of trade in services are primarily based on 11 mandatory BEA surveys of selected services receipts, payments, and other data. T hese data are supplemented by a combination of monthly indicator source data, partial data from U.S. government agencies and from foreign central statistical offices and banks, and other secondary source data. These source data are primarily used in estimating private investment in equipment and in software and in estimating exports and imports. The U.S. international trade statistics are jointly released by the two agencies about 5 weeks after the close of the reference month. International Transactions Accounts (ITAs), prepared by BEA , summarize the quarterly transactions between the United States and the rest of the world. In the ITAs, the current account records exports and imports of goods and services, receipts and payments of income on assets, and unilateral transfers (net gifts to other countries). In the capital and financial account, the capital account records capital transfers (such as debt forgiveness) and the financial account records transactions involving exchanges of financial assets for ot her financial assets or for tangible resources and gifts or grants of financial assets. These source data are primarily used in estimating corporate profits. The ITAs are released about 2½ months after the close of the reference quarter. Annual projections and quarterly farm data, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture , consist of annual projections of crop output, quarterly projections of cash receipts and of inventories for liv estock, and annual projections of government subsidy payments and production expenses for both crops and livestock.

The MTS presents a summary of receipts and outlays, surplus or deficit, and means of financing. The data are provided by federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks. These source data are primarily used in estimating federal g overnment receipts and expenditures and federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment. The MTS is usually releas ed about 8 days after the close of the reference month. Consumer Price Index (CPI) , prepared by BLS, is a family of indexes that measure the average monthly change in the prices paid by urban consumers for a fixed market basket of goods and services. The CPI covers “out -of-pocket” expenditures, including user fees (such as water and sewer service) and sales and excise taxes paid by the consumer but excluding income taxes and investment items (such as stocks, bonds, and life insurance). The CPI is estimate d from a statistical set of samples of urban areas, of consumers within those areas, of retailers and other outlets, and of specific, unique items purchased. CPIs are primarily used in deflating PCE, change in private inventories, and state and local government purchases. The CPI is released 2 –3 weeks after the close of the reference month. Producer Price Index (PPI) , prepared by BLS, is a family of indexes that measure the average monthly change in prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. In 2014, BLS significantly expanded its current coverage of the United States economy to over 75 percent of in-scope domestic production. The expansion featured a transition from stage -of-processing to final demand-intermediate demand aggregation by incorporating PPIs for services, construction, government purchases, and exports. 8 The PPI is estimated from data collected from a sample of establishments that participate in the Unemployment Insurance System, a joint f ederal and state program that covers about 97 percent of wage and salary workers . PPIs are primarily used in deflating private investment in structures and equipment, change in private inventories, government purchases, and exports and imports. The PPI is released about 2 weeks after the close of the reference month. International Price Index es, prepared by BLS, measure monthly changes in the prices of goods and services that are sold by U.S. producers to foreign buyers (exports) and that are purchased from abroad by U.S. buyers (imports). The price indexes for exports of goods to Canada are based primarily on sampling information obtained from the Canadian Customs Service, and the indexes for exports of goods to other countries are based on sampling information obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. The price indexes for imports of goods are based on sampling information obtained from Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The price indexes for exports and imports of services are based on sampling information that is developed separately for each service category.

Estimating schedule For GDP and most other NIPA series, the estimates for each quarter are prepared on a schedule that calls for three successive \"current\" estimates —\"advance,\" \" second ,\" and \" third .\" 9 The specific release date for each month is primarily determined by the availability of the monthly reports on retail sales, manufacturing shipments, and international trade in goods from the Census Bureau (along with the time it takes BEA to process them ). • The advance quarterly estimate of GDP is released near the end of the month that follows the close of the reference quarter. For most of the product-side components, the estimate is based on source data for either 2 or 3 months of the quarter. In most cases , however, the source data for the second and third months of the quarter are subject to revision by the issuing agencies. Where source data are not available, the estimate is based primarily on BEA projections. 10 • One month later, the advance estimate is replaced by the second estimate, which is typically based on source data for all 3 months of the quarter. However, in some instances , the source data used for the second estimate, particularly the data for the third month of the quarter, are subject to further revision. • One month later, the second estimate is replaced by the third estimate, which incorporates revisions to source data for the third month of the quarter and newly available quarterly source data for some components. For certain “income- side” series —gross national product, gross domestic income, national income, and corpo rate profits —“advance” estimates are not prepared, because of a lag in t he availability of source data. For the first, second, and third quarters of the year, the release of the second GDP estimate presents t he initial estimates for these income- side series, and the third GDP release presents revised estimates. For the fourth quarter, the estimates for these series are presented only in the third GDP release . In addition, when the second estimate of GDP for the current quarter is released, the preceding quarter’s estimate s of private wages and salaries and affected income- side aggregates are revised to incorporate newly available preliminary tabulations from the 9 In the 2009 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA introduced new names for the second two vintages of the current quarterly estimates.

The initial estimate continues to be named the “advance” estimate. (See Eugene P.

Annual Wholesale Trade Survey (AWTS) is a Census Bureau survey of companies that have significant activity in wholesale trade. These companies include wholesalers that take title of the goods they sell—such as jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and manufacturer sales branches and offices (MSBOs) —and, beginning in 2007, wholesalers that do not take title —such as agents, merchandise and commodity brokers, commission merchants, and electronic business -to-business marketers. Merchant wholesalers excluding MSBOs provide data on sale s, inventories, inventory valuation, purchases, and gross margin. MSBOs provide data on sales, inventories, inventory valuation, and operating expenses. The wholesa lers that do not take title provide data on sales, commissions earned, gross selling value of sales conducted for others, and operating expenses. The AWTS data are primarily used in estimating change in private inventories and nonfarm proprietors’ income.

Reported data are for each government’s annual accounting period (fiscal year) that ends on or before June 30 of the survey year. Data are obtained for revenue, expenditure, debt, and financial assets. These source data are primarily used in estimating state and local government spending, employee compensation, and taxes on production and imports. The data are available about 12 months after the close of the survey year. Annual revisi on of the International Transactions Accounts (ITAs) , prepared by BEA, incorporates newly available annual source data and statistical, methodological, and presentational improvements into the accounts, which may result in revisions that extend back for a number of years . 15 (The ITAs were described in the preceding section on sources for the current quarterly estimates.) These source data are primarily used in estimating exports of goods and services, and imports of goods and services. The annual update of the ITAs is released in mid -June. Annual farm statistics are collected in the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), which is sponsored jointly by the Economic Research Service and the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ARMS starts in the fall with the collection of data on crop production and cost s and finishes in the spring with the collection of data on whole farm and livestock production practices and costs . The data, which underpin USDA’s annual estimates of net farm income, cover virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture, including production and supplies, prices paid and received, farm labor and wages, and farm finances.

The benchmark I-O accounts , which are prepared at about 5-year intervals, incorporate a vast amount of source data, the most important of which are data from the Economic Census. The I -O account estimates are used extensively as benchmarks for many of the corresponding NIPA estimates, but I-O accounts also directly incorporate some of the NI PA estimates, such as the estimates for owner -occupied housing and for motor vehicles. The benchmark I- O accounts are released as part of the comprehensive update of the National Economic Accounts, which include the NIPAs and the Industry Economic Accounts. 18 Economic Census conducted by the Census Bureau, is a mandatory census that provi des a detailed portrait of the n ation’s economy once every 5 years. 19 The Economic Census consists of several censuses that cover nearly all private industries, including manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, construction, transportation, information, services, and finance and insurance. 20 In the 2007 Economic Census, report forms were sent to the establishments of all large employers (all multi-e stablishment firms and all firms with a payroll above a specified cutoff) and to a stratified sample of small employers (single- establishment f irms with payroll below the cutoff). Statistics for selected small employers (for example, those with fewer than 10 employees) and all firms without employees were compiled from administrative records of the IRS and other federal g overnment agencies . The Economic Census is the most important data source for the benchmark I- O accounts. Results from the Economic Census are released over a period of several years. Census of Governments , which is conducted by the Census Bureau in the same years as the Economic Census, is a voluntary census that provides periodic and comprehensive statistics about governments and governm ental activitie s.

The methodologies used to prepare the various NIPA estimates are periodically changed in order to incorporate improvements in the source data or in the estimating methods. 1 1 Substantive changes to NIPA methodologies are documented in BEA’s monthly Survey of Current Business , a nd this handbook is updated after each annual update of NIPAs .",
  "67": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-2 • Over time, source data may emerge or disappear, so new source data must be identified and evaluated, and estimating methods must be adapted accordingly. • Advances in statistical techniques or in other aspects of estimation must be evaluated for adoption into the methodology. • As the U.S. economy evolves, the methodologies must be updated to ensure that the estimates continue to provide a reliable and relevant picture of transactions and transactors in the economy. The examples provided in this chapter are simplified in order to illustrate the basic estimating concepts an d calculations. In practice, the procedures used for deriving the NIPAs involve complex statistical techniques that are designed to ensure consistency across the entire time series for a given estimate and between interrelated estimates. Current -Dollar E stimates For most NIPA components, the current -dollar, or nominal, estimates are derived from source data that are “value data,” which reflect the product of quantity and price. For the estimates that are not derived from value data, separate quantity data and price data must be comb ined. For example, an estimate of expenditures on new autos may be calculated as the number of autos sold times expenditure per auto ( at transaction prices —that is, the average list price with options adjusted for transportat ion charges, sales tax es, dealer discounts, and rebates). An estimate of wages may be calculated as employment times average hourly earnings times average hours worked, and an estimate of interest received may be calculated as the stock of interest -bearing assets times an effective interest rate. (The NIPA current -dollar estimates are expressed at annual rates; see the appendix to this chapter.) Adjustments to the source data BEA makes t hree general types of adjustments to the source data that are incorporated into the NIPA estimates. The first consists of adjustments that are needed so that the data conform to appropriate NIPA concepts and definitions. For example, Internal Revenue Service data from corporate tax return s include estimates of depreciation , but these estimates are based on historical -cost valuation and on tax service lives . BEA must adjust these estimates to the NIPA definition of depreciation —consumption of fixed capital —which is based on current -cost valuation and economic service l ives. The second type of adjustment involves filling gaps in coverage. For example, one of the primary sources for the quarterly estimates of the change in private inventories component of",
  "68": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-3 GDP is the Census Bureau’s Monthly W holesale Trade Survey. Howeve r, this source does not cover inventories of nonmerchant wholesalers (wholesalers that do not take title to the goods they sell). Thus, the survey data must be augmented by separate BEA estimates for the ch ange in the inventories of these wholesalers. The third type of adjustment involves time of recording and valuation. For example, in the NIPAs (as in BEA’s International T ransactions Accounts), imported goods are valued at “foreign port value”—that is, the value at the point of exportation to the United States. The source data on imports of goods from Canada, which the Census Bureau receives in a bilateral data exchange with Canada, are often valued at the point of manufacture ; thus, BEA must adjust these data to foreign port value by adding the cost of transporting these goods within Canada from the point of manufacture to the point of export to the United States . In addition, source data must occasionally be adjusted to account for special circumstances that affect the accuracy of the data. For example, the monthly current employment statistics are collected in the middle of the month, which is assumed to represent conditions during the entire month. Thus, these source data may need to be adjusted if a significant event, such as a bliz zard that blankets much of the eastern United States , occurs during that period. Seasonal adjustment Seasonal adjustment of a time series removes the average effect of variations that normally occur at about the same time and in about the same magnitude each year —for example, the effect of weather or holidays. After seasonal adjustment, trends, business cycles, and other movements in the time series stand out more clearly. Table 4 .1 and figure 4.1 illustrate the effects of seasonally adjusting a series that exhibits a significant seasonal pattern. The unadjusted series shows a pattern of consistent strength in the second and third quarters and corresponding weakness in the first and fourth quarte rs. The seasonally adjusted series removes that seasonal component resulting in a series that reflects trend s, business cycles, and other movements. Most of the source data agencies that provide BEA with data provide both seasonally adjusted data and not seasonally adjusted data. Where seasonally adjusted data are provided, BEA uses them to estimate quarterly and monthly NIPA estimates.",
  "69": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-4 For source data that are not available on a seasonally adjusted basis, BEA evaluates those series for seasonality usin g the Census Bureau’s X-13 ARIMA software.2 Where seasonality is identified , the seasonal adjustment applied to the source data that underlie NIPA estimates generally reflect s concurrent factors that are updated as additional data observations become available over the course of the year. Where seasonality is not found, the seasonally adjusted estimates will equal the not seasonally adjusted estimates (see the box “Introduction of Not Seasonally Adjusted Estimates”) . Where necessary, adjustments are made to ensure that seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted quarterly values sum to the annual value for a given year. Each year, as part of the annual NIPA update, BEA closely examines the seasonal adjustment of selected source data underlying the NIPA estimates . As part of this annual evaluation, the seasonality of each series is evaluated, model specifications for deriving seasonal factors are updated, and seasonal factors are recalculated. At a minimum, the updated factors are applied to the quarters and months for the most recent five years, consistent with BEA’s general revision policies and with seasonal adjustment best practices . In addition to examining selected source data, BEA also tests all NIPA series for seasonality. NIPA aggregates, which are indirectly seasonally adjusted by aggregating seasonally adjusted component detail, are carefully evaluated for residual seasonality. 3 As part of the 2018 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA introduced measures of GDP, GDI, and their major components that are not seasonally adjusted. These measures facilitate analyses of seasonal adjustment methods by distinguishing movements that are attributable to underlying source data from those that attributable to seasonal adjustment (see “Introduction of Not Seasonally Adjusted Estimates,” below). 2 X-13 ARIMA is a software program developed by the Census Bureau to identify and remove seasonal effects from a time series; for more information, see the Census Bureau website at www.census.gov. On occasions where a series lacks a sufficient time span to d erive seasonal factors, BEA may use smoothing techniques such as moving averages to reduce seasonality in the data. 3 Residual seasonality is a manifestation of seasonal patterns in data that have already been seasonally adjusted. For more information on residual seasonality and BEA’s associated research and improvements, see Benjamin Cowan, Shelly Smith, and Sarahelen Thompson, “ Seasonal Adjustment in the National Income and Product Accounts: Results from the 2018 Comprehensive Update ,” S urvey of Current Business 98 (August 2018).

  "71": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-6 Not Seasonally Adjusted Estimates As part of the 2018 comprehensive update of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), BEA introduced new not seasonally adjusted (NSA) quarterly estimates for GDP, GDI, and their major components ; quarterly estimates are available for 1947 forward. 1 The NSA estimates are an additional tool that may be used to evaluate quarterly economic performance and to distinguish movements attributable to the unadjusted underlying source data from those attributable to seasonal adjustment. As with seasonally adjusted estimates, the NSA estimates are often based on source data that are compiled for purposes other than measuring domestic production; as a result, the construction of NSA estimates is similar to the construction of their seasonally adjusted counterparts . Specifically, when NSA source data are available, they are adjusted to align with NIPA conventions. They then provide the indicator or pattern series for the corresponding NSA NIPA estimate (see section below on “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series ). When source data are unavailable, most NSA estimates are set equal to their SA counterpart . The NSA estimates are presen ted in Section 8 of the NIPA Interactive Data Tables. 2 For GDP and its major components, the tables present nominal, or “current -dollar” measures, “real,” or inflation –adjusted measures (expressed as a chain -type quantity index and as chained 2017 dollars) , and price indexes. For GDI and its major components, nominal measures are presented. The quarterly estimates are expressed at quarterly, not annual, rates.3 In addition, BEA presents the percent change from the same quarter one year ago for real GDP and its major components in NIPA table 8.1.11. The rate of change published for these NSA estimates is calculated from the same quarter 1 year ago to reduce the variations observed from seasonal fluctuations and to reveal data trends over the course of a year. This rate is not comparable to the quarterly rate of change published for BEA's featured seasonally adjusted series, which is calculated from the preceding quarter, and expressed at a compound a nnual rate. Comparing NSA estimates from the same quarter 1 year ago does not necessarily remove seasonal patterns from the data. Calendar effects, such as the timing of holidays and trading days, as well as other special events can influence the estimates and cause year -over-year comparisons to be misleading. For t hese reasons, seasonally adjusted statistics are preferred for evaluating growth in BEA's GDP and GDI statistics. Updates to the estimates will follow the same publication schedule as the seasonally adjusted statistics. 1. The NSA estimates are not comparable to BEA’s previously published current- dollar GDP NSA estimates, which were discontinued in 2008. The earlier estimates were largely based on SIC-based data and were published once a year as part of the NIPA annual updates. NSA GDI, real GDP, and GDP price estimates were not provided. 2. Prior to the 2018 comprehensive update, BEA presented not seasonally adjusted estimates for federal and state and local government current receipts and expenditures in NIPA tables 3.22 and 3.23 that were published once a year; the two tables are now renumbered as tables 8.3 and 8.4, respectively and are published at the same time as the seasonally adjusted estimates . 3. For more details on the presentation of NIPA estimates, see the section on “Whe re are the NIPA estimates available?” in Chapter 1: Estimating Methods . BEA does not publish annual frequency NSA data because the NSA quarterly estimates are reconciled to the seasonally adjusted annual estimates with the annual and comprehensive updates of the NIPAs .",
  "72": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-7 Moving average A moving average is a calculation that is used to smooth a data series that is characterized by volatile short -term fluctuations. As a result, trend and cyclical movements in the smoothed series will be more apparent, and the series can be better used as an indicator for interpolation and extrapolation (see below). Table 4 .2 illustrate s the smoothing effects of a three- quarter moving average on a volatile series . The simple moving average is calculated by summing the value in a given quarter and in the preceding two quarters and dividing by 3 (in year 1:III, (90.0 + 120.0 + 100.0) ∕ 3 = 103.3). A weighted moving average is calculated by assigning greater weight t o the time periods that are deemed more relevant. In this example, the weighted moving average is calculated by weighting the current quarter at 50 percent , and the two preceding quarters at 25 percent each (in year 1:III, ( (90.0 × 0.50) + (120.0 × 0.25) + (100.0 × 0.25) = 100.0).

  "73": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-8 Best level and best change Source data are incorporated into the NIPA estimates on either a “best -level” or a “best - change” basis. Best level provides the most accurate value for an economic statistic at a specified point in time using the best available source data. For example, in a comprehensive update of the NIPAs, data from the quinquennia l Economic Census are incorporated into the estimates on a best-level basis. However, it is not practical to revise the entire NIPA time series every time new or revised source data become available. Thus, these data are often initially introduced into the estimates on a best- change basis. Best change provides the most accurate measure of the period - to-period movement in an economic statistic using the best available source data. In an annual update of the NIPAs, data from the annual surveys of manufacturing and trade are generally incorporated into the estimates on a best- change basis . In the current quarterly estimates, most of the components are estimated on a best -change basis from the annual levels established at the most recent annual update. In table 4 .3, the original series of source data (column 1) has been revised as shown by the best -level series (column 3) . In the example, the level of the series has been revised up in all years, perhaps reflecting a change in definition, and the percent changes in the series have been revised to incorporate new statistical information. In an annual NIPA revision, the revised levels of the source data cannot be fully incorporated, because annual updates only cover the 5 most recent years. 4 As can be seen in this example, incorporating the revised best- level series only for years 2 –4 would result in a discontinuity between the unrevised estimate for year 1 (100.0) and the revised estimate for year 2 (115.0) (a 15.0- percent increase rather than the 10.6 -percent increase indicated by the source data). To avoid this problem, the revised s ource data are instead incorporated on a best- change basis —that is, a new best-change series is created by beginning with the value in the unrevised year 1 (100.0) and applying the percent changes in the best- level series (column 4). As a result, the leve l of the new series (column 5) is kept consistent with the level of the earlier unrevised year, while the percent changes in the new series (column 6) fully reflect the new statistical information that was incorporated into the source data. In the next comprehensive update , the revised best -levels w ould be incorporated into the NIPA estimates. 4 As part of the 2018 comprehensive revision of the NIPAs, BEA changed the typical open period for annual updates of the NIPAs from 3 to 5 years. As part of the “flexible” approach to annual updates that BEA introduced in 2010, the open period may be extended beyond 5 years to allow for the incorporation of improvements in methodology.

Wasshausen, “ Improved Estima tes of the National Income and Product Accounts: Results of the 2018 Comprehensive Update ,” Survey 98 (September 2018) and “BEA Briefing: Improv ing BEA’s Accounts Through Flexible Annual Revisions ,” Survey 88 (June 2008): 29– 32..",

Thus, f or most estimates, the more frequent but less comprehensive source data may be used as an indicator of the movements of the component series rather than as a measure of the absolute levels of the series. Specifically, for the periods for which annual estimates are available and the quarterly estimates must be forced to average to these annual totals, the quarterly pattern is estimated by interpolation. For the periods not yet covered by annual estimates (such as the current quarter), the quarterly estimates are made by extrapolat ion. The use of an indicator series to estimate a component is illustrated in table 4 .4. We begin with a value of $200 (annual rate) for the fourth quarter of year 1 (this value was determined by the preceding year’s calculation) and a value of $220 for the year 2 (this value was determined from an annual data source ). Because the detailed source data are not available on a quarterly basis, the estimates for the quarters of year 2 are interpolated using an indicator series whose movements are deemed to approximate those of the component series. In this simplified example, the interpolation of the quarterly values is accomplished by calculating a time series that begins with the est ablished value ($200) for the fourth quarter of year 1 and progresses through the four quarters of year 2 at the same rate of change as the indicator series: for year 2:I, $200 + ($200 × 0.20) = $240; for year 2:II, $240 + ($240 × –0.167) = $200; and so forth . As necessary, the calculated series is then adjusted to ensure that the average for the four quarters of year 2 is equal to the established annual value for year 2 : for year 2:I, $240 × ($220 ∕ $240) = $220; for year 2: II, $200 × (220 ∕ $240) = $183.3; and so forth.",

Currently, BEA is using a procedure known as the “proportional Denton method” or “quadratic minimization.” In its most common application, this appr oach interpolates series by minimizing the sum of the squared differences of the ratios of the interpolated series and the indicator series. Formally, the interpolation is estimated by the following optimization problem: where z is the indicator series, x is the interpolated series, A are the annual controls that the interpolated series must sum to, and N is the number of years for the interpolation. This example shows an annual- to-quarterly i nterpolation. The same method can also be used for annual- to- monthly and quarterly- to-monthly interpolation. 5 5 See Baoline Chen and Stephen H.

  "76": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-11 Three special estimation methods In certain cases where primary source data are not available, one or more of the following special methods—commodity flow, retail control, or perpetual inventory—may be used to estimate values. Commodity -flow method The commodity -flow method is generally used to derive estimates in economic census years for various components of consumer spending, equipment and software, and the commodity detail for state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment. An abbreviated form of this method is used to prepare estimates of investment in equipment in nonbenchmark years, and an even mor e abbreviated form is used to prepare the current quarterly estimates of investment in equipment.6 The commodity-flow method begins with estimates of the domestic output or domestic sales of a commodity valued in producers’ prices.7 Then, e stimates of the domestic supply of that commodity —the amount that is available for domestic consumption—are prepared by adding imports and by subtracting exports and inventory change. Next , the domestic supply of the commodity is allocated among domestic purchasers—that is, persons, business, and government. Finally, the estimates are converted to purchasers’ prices.8 The commodity-flow method is illustrated in table 4 .5. First, domestic shipm ents—the value of shipments of the commodity produced by dome stic firms at producers’ prices—are converted to net supply, by adding imports and subtracting exports, government purchases, and change in inventories (a positive change in inventories reduces net supply and a negative change in inventories raises net supply) (in the example, $100 + $40 – $10 – $5 – $5 = $120). Portions of the net s upply are then allocated among business intermediate purchases and consumer spending. This allocation may be based on relationships from the most recent Economic Census or on information from other sources (such as spending by consumers as determined by the retail control method). In this example, it is assumed that one-fourth of net supply is allocated to business int ermediate purchases and one-sixth to personal consumption expenditures. Investment in equipment (prior to adjustments for transportation costs and wholesale and retail trade margins) is then computed as net supply less business intermediate purchases and consumer 6 For more information on using the commodity- flow method to prepare the estimates of investment in equipment, see “Chapter 6: Private Fixed Investment .” 7 Producers’ prices are the prices received by producers for the goods and services they sell. These prices include sales and excise taxes but exclude domestic transportation costs and trade margins. Trade margins, or markups, reflect the value added by wholesalers and retailers in the distribution of a commodity from producers to final purchasers. 8 Purchasers’ prices are the prices paid by intermediate and final purchasers for the goods and services they buy. These prices are equal to producers’ prices plus domestic transportation costs and trade margins.",
  "77": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-12 spending (in the example, $120 – $30 – $20 = $70). This estimate is then converted to purchasers’ prices by adding domestic transportation costs and trade margins ($70 + $5 + $10 = $85).

In these years, the estimate of total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) on most goods is derived by extrapolation from the benchmark year using a retail control total of sales by most kinds of business from the Census Bureau’s monthly and annual surveys. In general, product- based data on consumer spending are not available in nonbenchmark years, so the estimates for the detailed PCE categories are prepared by extrapolation using estimates of retail sales by corresponding product lines that, in turn, are based on retail sales by kind of business and on commodity sales data from the most recent quinquennial Economic Census.9 Then, the extrapolated estimates are adjusted proportionately so that their sum is equal to that for total PCE.10 9 The estimates for some PCE categories, such as consumer purchases of new and used motor vehicles and of motor vehicle fuels, are prepared independently. 10 For more information on using the retail cont rol method to prepare the PCE estimates, see “ Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures .”",
  "78": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-13 The retail control me thod is illustrated in table 4.6. First, the PCE control total for year 2 is derived by extrapolati on, using the change in the retail c ontrol total f rom year 1 to year 2 (89 × (120 ∕ 100) = 106.8) . In year 1 , a benchmark year , information from the Econom ic Census is available to break sales down into product lines (and to corresponding PCE categories) for each kind of business (such as “grocery stores”) . In year 2, the annual survey of retail sales provides data on sales by kind of business but not on sal es by individual product lines . In order to estimate sales by product line for year 2 , the product -line distribution of sales from year 1 is applied to the sales by kind of business for year 2 (for kind of business A, 0.2 × 60 = 12 for product line 1, and 0.8 × 60 = 48 for product line 2). Total s ales for each product line are then computed by summing across all kind s of business (for product line 1, 12 + 36 = 48; and for product line 2, 48 + 24 = 72) . The retail sales product line s in the Census Bureau’s data and the PCE categories in the NIPAs do not always match (i n the example, product line 1 at 44 is larger than PCE category 1 at 33). Thus, the retail sales data are used to extrapolate the PCE estimates for year 2 (for product line 1, 33 × (48 ∕ 44) = 36). Finally, the PCE category estimates must be adjusted so they sum to the PCE control total for year 2 (f or product line 1, the adjusted est imate for year 2 is 36 × (106.8 ∕ 108) = 35.6) .",

In year 1, the estimates of the beginning- of-year stocks for two types of asset s, A and B , are equal to the end -of-year stocks for the preceding year . 12 For asset A, the end- of-year stock in year 2 is equal to the beginning- of- year stock in year 2 plus the value of investment in asset A during the year minus the value of depreciation during that year ($110 + $20 – $11 = $119) .

  "81": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-16 Quantity and Price Estimates Estimates for all of the NIPA aggregates and components are presented in current dollars. Changes in current- dollar estimates measure the changes in the market values of goods or services that are produced or sold in the economy. For many purposes, it is necessary to decompose these changes into price and quantity components. In the NIPAs, prices and quantities are expressed as index numbers with the reference year —at present, the year 2017— equal to 100. For selected series, q uantities —or “real” (inflation adjusted) measures—are also expressed in chained (2017) dollars . (Period -to-period changes in quantities and prices are expressed as percent changes at annual rates; see “Statistical Tools and Conventions” in the appendix to this chapter.) BEA prepares quantity estimates for GDP and its product-side component s and for a few other aggregates and components. ( For a n illustration of the calculation of these estimates from a set of quantity and price information, see “Calculation of Output and Price Indexes” in the appendix to this chapter.) Estimates for detailed components For the detailed NIPA components, the quantity estimates are prepared using one of three methods—deflation, quantity extrapolation, or direct valuation—depending on the availability of source data. The quantity estimates are expressed as real values with 2017 (at present) as the reference year. Deflation Because the source data available for most components of GDP are measured in dollars rather than in units, the quantities of most of the detailed components are obtained by deflation. For deflation, quantities are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by an “appropriate” price index (with the reference- year value set to 100) : Q t = (p tqt)∕(p t∕po) where p t and q t are observed prices and quantities in the cur rent year and p o is the observed price in the reference year.13 13 A price index is appropriate if its definition and coverage closely match those of the series being deflated.",
  "82": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-17 Thus, for example, if the current-dollar value for the component series is $14 in 2013 and the appropriate price index is 112 in 2013, then the quantity estimate for the component series in 2013 is ($14 ∕ (112 ∕ 100)), or $12.50. The price indexes used for deflation are generally adjusted for changes in characteristics or quality as described in the appendix to this chapter. Quantity extrapolation The other two methods are similar in that they both are derived using quantity data. Quantity extrapolation is used when a quantity indicator series is available that approximates the movements of the component series. In this method, the quantity estimate is obtained by using the indicator series to extrapolate from the reference- year value: Q t = p oqo+((p oqo) × ((q t′ –qo′)∕qo′)) where q′ represents the quantity indicator series. For example, if the dollar value of the component series is $10 in 2017 and the quantity indicator series shows an increase of 25 percent in 2018, then the quantity estimate for the component series in 2018 is ($10 + ($10 × 25/100)), or $12.50. Direct valuation Direct valuation is used when physical quantity data and price data are available. In this method, the quantity estimate is obtained by multiplying the reference- year price by the actual quantity data for the current year: Q t = p oqt. For example, if the price of the detailed component is $.50 per unit in 2017 and the quantity measure is 20 units in 2017 and 25 units in 2018, then the quantity estimate for the component series in 2018 is ($.50 × 25), or $12.50. Estimate s for NIPA aggregates The fundamental problem confronting the efforts to adjust GDP and other aggregates for inflation is that there is not a single inflation number but rather a wide spectrum of goods and services with prices that are changing relative to one another over time. The index numbers for",

In the NIPAs, the annual changes in quantities and prices are calculated using a Fisher formula that incorporates weights from 2 adjacent years.14 For example, the 20 14–2015 change in real GDP uses prices for 2014 and 2015 as weights, and the 2014–2015 change in prices uses quantities for 20 14 and 2015 as weights. These annual changes are “chained” (multiplied) together to form time series of quantity and price indexes. Quarterly changes in quantities and prices are calculated using a Fisher formula that incorporates weights from two adjacent quarters; quarterly indexes are adjusted for consistency to the annual indexes before percent changes are calculated. The Fisher index ( F tQ) for calculating real GDP (and other aggregate measures of output and expenditures) in year t relative to its value in the previous year t-1 is where the p 's and q's represent prices and quantities of detailed components in the 2 years. Because the first term in the Fisher formula is a Laspeyres quantity index ( QL t): and the second term is a Paasche quantity index ( P tQ): the Fisher formula can also be expressed for year t as the geometric mean of these indexes as follows: 14 This formula is named after Irving Fisher, who originally developed this index to more accurately m easure quant ity and price changes over time. , q pq p q pq p=Q 1 - t tt t 1 - t 1 - tt 1 - t F t∑∑×∑∑ , q pq p=Q 1 - t 1 - tt 1 - t L t∑∑ , q pq p=Q 1 - t tt t P t∑∑ ✓--",

All quarterly chain -type indexes for completed years that have been included in an annual or comprehensive update are adjusted so that the quart erly indexes average to the corresponding annual index.

  "85": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-20 Properties of chain -type measures The chain -type indexes based on the Fisher formula have several advantages over the fixed -weighted indexes that BEA used before 1996.15 • They produce percent changes in quantities and prices that are not affected by the choice of the reference period . • They eliminate the substitution bias in measures of real GDP growth that are derived using fixed-weighted indexes. This bias tends to cause an understatement of growth for periods before the reference year and an overstatement of growth for periods after the reference year. • They eliminate the distortion s of growth in components and in industries that result from the fixed -weighted indexes. • They eliminate the anomalies that arise from using recent -period weights to measure periods in the past when a far different set of prices prevailed. For example, the prices of defense equipme nt in the 2000s are not appropriate for measuring the real changes in defense spending in the 1940s. • They eliminate the inconvenience and confusion associated with BEA’s previous practice of updating weights and years—and thereby rewriting economic history—about every 5 years. Despite the greater accuracy provided by the chain -type indexes, users of macroeconomic statistics need more than index numbers and percent changes. The earlier fixed -weighted estimates were deno minated in constant dollars, and the r eal levels for the components of GDP added up to total GDP. Because the system was additive, the shares of the real components reflected their relative importance in total GDP. Similarly, in decomposing total GDP growth by component, the change in constant-dollar values measured the component’s contribution to the change in the fixed -weighted aggregate. For GDP and most of its components, BEA prepares estimates in chained dollars as well as chain -type indexes (see the appendix to this chapter). However, because the se chained -dollar measures are not based on a single set of weights, they are not additive and thus do not yield accurate measures of shares and contributions to growth. 15 For information on BEA’s introduction of chain- type indexes as its featured measure of real output and prices, see J. Steven Landefeld and Robert P. Parker, “ Preview of the Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: BEA’s New Featured Measures of Output and Prices ,” S urvey 75 (July 1995): 31– 38. See also J.

In addition, BEA provides measures of percentage shares that are based on current -dollar values. B ecause current -dollar values provide the weights for the chain -type indexes, shares calculated fr om these estimates rather than fr om the chained -dollar estimates should be used to indicate the relative importance of components .",
  "87": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-22 APPENDIX Calculation of Output and Price Indexes The market (and nonmarket) values used to measure GDP and the other NIPA estimates are in current dollars —that is, they represent the values of transactions taking place in the current time period. In turn, these tr ansactions reflect a combination of physical quantities and prices. As shown in exhibit 4.1, in year 1, 10 apples at a price of $0.20 per apple can be purchased for $2.00. If the transactions in a given time period are compared with those in another time p eriod, the differences in the current -dollar values can be attributed to differences in quantities and to differences in prices. In year 2, 20 apples at a price of $0.25 per apple can be purchased for $5.00. The increase in expenditures from $2.00 to $5.00, or 150 percent, can be separated into quantity and price elements. The quantity of apples purchased increased from 10 to 20, or 100 percent, and the price of apples increased from $0.20 to $0.25 or 25 percent. Exhibit 4.1 Year 1 Expenditures Quantity Price Apples $2.00 10 $0.20 Oranges $3.00 30 $0.10 Total fruit $5.00 Year 2 Apples $5.00 20 $0.25 Oranges $4.00 20 $0.20 Total fruit $9.00 For most NIPA components, estimates of physical quantities are not available. Instead, “real” estimates —that is, estimates that exclude the effects of price change —are derived by “deflating” (dividing) the current -dollar value by appropriate price indexes. In order to prepare such estimates, a statistical application must be used that establishes a common unit price as the basis for comparison. For exhibit 4.1, one way to accomplish this is to value the second- period transaction in the price of the first period: 20 apples at the year 1 price of $0.20 is equal to $4.00, and so the real estimate increases from $2.00 in year 1 to $4.00 in year 2, or 100 percent. Alternatively, the first- period transaction could have been val ued in second -period prices: 10 apples at the year 2 price of $0.25 is equal to $2.50, and so the real estimate increases from $2.50 in year 1 to $5.00 in year 2, or 100 percent.",
  "88": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-23 Thus, the separation of current -dollar change into price and quantity elements for a single, detailed component is strai ghtforward. However, for an aggregation of detailed components, price changes and quantity changes cannot be observed directly in the economy. Thus, the partitioning of the current -dollar change into price - and quantity- change elements becomes an analytic process. The price and quantity changes must be calculated, and the calculation method is determined by analytic requirements. Because of the complexity of the interactions of prices and quantit ies, the method of calculating real estimates for the NIPAs ha s evolved over time . Estimates of real G NP and other components were introduced into the NIPAs in the early 1950s as a supplement to the current -dollar estimates. The se measures were calculated by specifying a single base period set of prices and then va luing the output of all periods using those prices. As shown i n calculation 1 in exhibit 4.2 (page 4–19), which uses year 1 for valuation, the real estimate for the change in fruit from year 1 to year 2 is 20 percent. This approach, in which the real est imates are calculated moving forward from the base period, is called a “Laspeyres” quantity index. However, the results of the calculation are dependent on the choice of the base year for valuation. In calculation 2, which uses year 2 for valuation, the re al estimate for the change in fruit from year 1 to year 2 is 6 percent. This approach, in whic h the estimates are calculated moving backward from the current period, is called a “Paasche” quantity index. Corresponding calculations can be made to produce La speyres and Paasche price indexes. Before 1996, the real estimates in the NIPAs were calculated as Laspeyres quantity indexes, and the price estimates were calculated as implicit price deflators. 16 In calculation 4, the estimate for the change in the price of fruit from year 1 to year 2 is 50 percent. Note that one property of these estimates is that the index for total expenditures on fruit in year 2 ($9.00 / $5.00, or 1.800) is equal to the Laspeyres quantity index for year 2 multiplied by the Paasche price index for year 2: 1.200 × 1.500 = 1.800. In 1996, BEA introduced chain- weighted indexes as its featured measure of the change in real GDP and in prices. These indexes, which are based on weights that are more appropriate to the time period being measured, significantly improved the accuracy of the NIPA estimates. The weights for these measures are calculated as the geometric mean of the calculations for the Laspeyres index and the Paasche index (in exhibit 4.1, as the square root of 1.200 × 1.059, or 1.127). Similarly, price measures are computed using weights calculated as the geometric mean of the calculations for the Laspeyres index and the Paasche index (in exhibit 1, as the square root 16 In the exhibit, all calculations involve only 2 years, so the Paasche price index and the implicit price deflator are equivalent.",

Note that for the chain-type measures, the Fisher quantity index for year 2 multiplied by the Fisher price index for year 2 is also equal to the index for total expenditures on fruit in year 2: 1.127 × 1.597 = 1.800.

Adjusting for quality change Accurate price indexes are crucial for preparing accurate estimates of real GDP as well as corresponding productivity measures. The illustrations shown above assume that there are changes only in the prices and quantities of the goods or services being measured. The development of a price index becomes more complicated when the characteristics or quality of Exhibit 4.2 Calculation 1: Laspeyres Quantity Index Year 1 w eighted quantity change measure for fruit: hypothetical expenditure on fruit in year 2 using year 1 prices, divided by actual expenditure on fruit in year 1 [(20 × $0.20) + (20 × $0.10)] ∕ [(10 × $0.20) + (30 × $0.10)] = $6.00 ∕ $5.00 = 1.200 Calculation 2: Paasche Quantity Index Year 2 weighted quantity change measure for fruit: actual expenditure on fruit in year 2, divided by hypothetical expenditure on fruit in year 1 using year 2 prices [(20 × $0.25) + (20 × $0.20)] ∕ [(10 × $0.25) + (30 × $0.20)] =$9.00 ∕ $8.50 = 1.059 Calculation 3: Laspeyres Price Index Year 1 weighted price change measure for fruit: [(10 × $0.25) + (30 × $0.20)] ∕ [(10 × $0.20) + (30 × $0.10)] = $8.50 ∕ $5.00 = 1.700 Calculation 4: Paasche Price Index Year 2 weighted price change measure for fruit: [(20 × $0.25) + (20 × $0.20)] ∕ [(20 × $0.20) + (20 × $0.10)] =$9.00 ∕ $6.00 = 1.500",
  "90": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-25 the goods or services are also changing. In these cases, the price index must isolate and measure only t he price change and not the impacts of these other changes. There are several methods used to construct price indexes, and while most of these are designed to measure price change while holding quality constant, no method is perfect in every situation.17 Traditional matched model indexes, which hold quality constant by specifying each variety in the sample and ensuring that exactly the same variety of product is sampled each period, work well with relatively standardized products . However, these indexes are less accurate when the characteristics, quality, market shares, and prices are changing rapid ly. In such cases, alternative methods for quality adjustment may yield more accurate measures. The attribute- cost adjustment method , adopted recently by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to construct the consumer price index ( CPI) for computers, uses m onetary values of the attributes that affect price, obtained from the original equipment manufacturer s or from price compiler websites , to determine appropriate quality adjustments. 18 The h edonic method us es regression analysis to determine statistical relationships between observed price changes and changes in the characteristics and qualities of the products, and these relationships are used to hold quality constant; this method is used by BLS in many of its producer and consumer price indexes and by the Census Bureau in its housing construction and sales price indexes. Both techniques have been shown to produce price indexes that are more accurate than traditional matched model indexes in cases of rapid change. 19 BEA’s primary source of indexes to deflate GDP and its components is BLS, which provides detailed price indexes—including consumer price indexes, producer price indexes, and international price indexes . These indexes , as well as other indexes from BLS, the Census Bureau, and other federal agencies , all employ methodologies to adjust for quality change. In cases where quality -adjusted indexes have not been available, BEA has developed its own indexes. For example, for a number of years in the 1980s and early 1990s, BEA produced hedonic indexes for computers; as BLS began publishing quality-adjusted PPIs for computers and peripheral equipment in the 1990s, BEA adjusted its methodologies to incorporate them. In the late 1990s, BEA introduced quality-adjusted price indexes for semiconductors, for digital telephone switching equipment, and for computer software; more recently, BEA has introduced a hedonic price index for photocopying equipment. 20 17 An exception is a unit value index, which measures the change in the value of items without holding characteristics, quality, or even the mix of items constant. 18 For more information on how BLS calculates the CPI for computers, see https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/pers onal-computers.htm . 19 For more information on the hedonic method underlying producer and consumer price indexes, see Chapter 14, Producer Prices , and Chapter 17, The Consumer Price Index , of the BLS Handbook of Methods . For more information on the hedonic method underlying housing price indexes, see the information available on the Census website at https://www.census.gov/construct ion/cpi/ . 20 For more information these quality- adjustment techniques, see “ Prices and Output for Information and Communicatio n Technologies ,” on BEA’s website.",
  "91": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-26 Statistical Tools and Conventions This section describes some of the statistical tools and conventions that BEA uses in preparing and presenting the NIPA estimates. In general, these statistical operations are used to transform the estimates into alternative formats that facilitate analytical or prese ntational uses. Chained- dollar measures As a supplement to its chain -type quantity indexes, BEA prepares measures of real GDP and its components in a dollar-denominated form, designated “chained (2017) dollar” estimates. For GDP and most other series, t he chained -dollar value CDF t is calculated by multiplying the reference year current -dollar value q pb b∑)by the chain -type Fisher quantity index ( IF t) and dividing by 100. For period t , /100IFtq p = CDFt b b× ∑ . Thus, for example, if a current -dollar GDP component is equal to $200 in 2017 and if the quantity index for this component increased 15 percent by 2020, then the chained (2017) dollar value of this co mponent in 2020 would be $200 x 115 ∕ 100, or $230. The chained ( 2017) dollar estimates provide measures to calculate the percent changes for GDP and its components that are consistent with those calculated from the chain-type quantity indexes; any differences are small and due to rounding. For most components of GDP, the chained -dollar estimates also provide rough approximations of their relative importance and of their contributions to real GDP growth for years close to 2017. However, for components — such as computers and other high- tech equipment —with rapid growth in real output and sharply falling prices, the chained -dollar levels (as distinct from chain -weighted indexes and percent changes) will overstate their relative importance to GDP growth. In addition, chained-dollar values for the detailed GDP components will not necessarily sum to the chained- dollar estimate of GDP (or of any intermediate aggregate) , because the relative prices used as weights for any period other than the reference year differ from those used for the reference year. BEA provides a measure of the extent of such differences by showing a “residual” line on chained -dollar tables that indicates the difference between GDP (and other major aggregates) and the sum of the most detailed components in the table. For periods close to the reference year, when there usually has not been much change in the relative prices that are used as the weights for calculating the chain -type index, the residuals",
  "92": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-27 tend to be small, and the chained (2017 ) dollar estimates can be used to approximate the contributions to growth and to aggregate the detailed estimates. However, it is preferable to use estimates of exact contributions, which are described in the next section. Some exceptions to the above methodology are made for a few components of GDP. For cases in which the components of an aggregate include large negative values, the Fisher formula cannot be used because it would require taking the square root of a negative number. In such cases, one of two other methods is used. • Quantity estimates are calculated as the sum of, or as the difference between, chained - dollar series that measure flows. For example, real net exports is derived as the difference between real exports and real imports. • Quantity estimates are calculated as the difference between measures of chain -weighted stocks. For example, the real annual change in private inventories is derived as the difference between real beginning -of-year inventories and real end- of-year inventories. The inability to calculate a particular Fisher quantity index (for example, for change in private inventories) because of negative values usually does not extend to the calculation of higher level aggregates (for example, quantity indexes for gross private domestic investment and for GDP can be computed). The calculation of contributions to percent change is not affected by negative values, so they can be calculated for all components. The chain -dollar estimates are used in the calculation of another price index, the implicit price deflator (IPD). The IPDFtfor period t is calculated as the ratio of the current -dollar value to the corresponding chained-dollar value, multiplied by 100, as follows: For all aggregates and components and for all time periods, the value of the IPD is very close t o the value of the corresponding chain -type price index. Note that this definition of the IPD differs from that used before the introduction of chain-type measures in1996, when the IPD was defined as the ratio of the current -dollar value to the corresponding constant- dollar value. Contributions to percent change As one moves further away from the reference year, the residual tends to become larger, and the chained -dollar estimates are less useful for analyses of contributions to growth. For this 100 CDq p= IPDF tt t F t ×∑.",
  "93": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-28 reason, BEA also shows contributions of major components to the percent change in real GDP (and to the percent change in other major aggregates) that use exact formulas for attributing growth. The contributions to percent change in a real aggregate, such as real GDP, provide a measure of the composition of growth in the aggregate that is not affected by the nonadditivity of its components. This property makes contributions to percent change a valuable tool for economic analysis. The contribution to percent change ( ∆ti, C%) in an aggregate in period t that is attributable to the quantity change in component i is defined by the formula where PF t is the Fisher price index for the aggregate in period t relative to perio d t-1; pi,t is the price of the component i in period t ; and qi,t is the quantity of the component i in period t . The summation with subscript j in the denominator includes all the deflation-level components of the aggregate. Contributions of subaggregates (such as PCE goods) to the percent change of the aggregate (say, PCE or GDP) are calculated by summing the contributions of all the deflation -level components contained in the subaggregate. 21 For annual estimates, no adjustments are required for the contributions to sum exactly to the percent change in the aggregate. For quarterly estimates, adjustments are required to offset the effects of adjustments that were made to equate the average of the quarterly estimates to the corresponding annual estimate and to express the percent change at annual rate. The same formula is used for both annual and quarterly estimates of contributions to percent change in all periods. The only variation in the method of calculation is that the annual contributions for the most recent year are based on a weighted average of the quarterly contributions until the next annual update. 21 See Marshall B. Reinsdorf, W. Erwin Diewert, and Christian Ehemann, “Additive Decompositions for Fisher, Tornqvist, and Geometric Mean Indexes,” Journal of Economic and Social Measurem ent 28 (2002): 51 –61, www.econ.ubc.ca/diewert/additive.pdf. ,) ) / (() ( ) ) / ((100 % 1 , 1 , ,1 , , 1 , , ,∑ − −− − × +− × +× = ∆ j t j t jF t t jt i t i t iF t t i t iq p P pq q p P pC",
  "94": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-29 Annual rates Quarterly and monthly NIPA estimates in current and chained dollars are presented at annual rates, which show the value that would be registered if the level of activity measured for a quarter or for a month were maintained for a full year . Annual rates are used so that periods of different lengths—for example, quarters and years—may be easily compared. These annual rates are determined simply by multiplying the estimated rate of activity by 4 (for quarterly data) or by 12 (for monthly data). Growth rates In general, percent changes in the NIPA estimates are also expressed at annual rates, which show the value that would be registered if the pace of activity measured for a time period were maintained for a full year. 22 Calculating these changes requires a variant of th e compound interest formula, where r is the percent change at an annual rate; GDP t is the level of activity in the later period; GDP 0 is the level of activity in the earlier period; m is the periodicity of the data (for example, 1 for annual data and 4 for quarterly data); and n is the number of periods between the earlier and later periods (that is, t-0). Thus, for example, if a component increases from $100 in the first quarter to $105 in the second quarter (5 percent at a quarterly rate), the annual rate of increase is (($105/$100) 4/1 – 1) x 100 = 21.6 percent. Rebasing an index In the NIPAs, quantities and prices are generally expressed as index numbers with a reference year —at present, the year 2017—equal to 100. These indexes can easily be rebased to a different r eference year without changing the relationship between the series values. To rebase, 22 The growth rates in the NIPA monthly series, such as personal income, are not expressed at annual rates. 100, 1 GDPGDP= r 0tm/n ×        –",

In the seve n summary accounts of the NIPAs, PCE appear s in the Domestic Income and Produc t Account (Account 1), where it is the large st compone nt of final demand, and in the Personal Income and Outlay A ccount (Account 3 ), where it is the domina nt outl ay. In the NIPAs, PCE by ma jor type of produc t is p resented in NIP A table group 2.3, a nd more deta iled informa tion by ty pe of produc t is presented in NIP A table group 2.4. This prese ntation is b ased on the classification of the PCE categorie s into dura ble goods, nondura ble goods, and servi ces (for more informat ion, s ee the section “Type of product ” in Chapter 2).

The tables present nominal, or “current -dollar” measures, “real,” or inflation -adjusted measures, and price indexes. Additionally, BEA p repare s “Underlying Deta il Tables” for PCE by ty pe of product that provide curre nt-doll ar, cha ined-doll ar, and price e stimates at a greater level of deta il than are shown in the above tables. BEA d oes not in clude these deta iled e stimates in the publishe d tables because their quality is signifi cantly lower than that of the higher-level categorie s of which they are a part. In particular, these deta iled e stimates are more likely to be base d on judgme ntal trends or on less reliable source dat a. Overview of Source Data and Estimatin g Methods As described earlier, the NIPA e stimates, including those for PCE, are prep ared using a wide variety of source data (see “ Chapter 3: Principal Source Data ”) and usi ng estimating methods tha t adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and tha t fill in ga ps in coverage and timing (see “ Chapter 4: Estimating Methods ”). For PCE, the e stimates are base d on statistical reports, p rimarily from the U.S. Census Burea u but a lso from other g overnm ent agencie s; on a dministra tive and regula tory agency re ports; and on re ports from p rivate organizations, su ch as trade associations. The following are a mong the principal source da ta used for the PCE estimates: BEA ’s Benc hmark Input-Output (I-O) Acc ounts, whi ch are base d prim arily on the Census Bureau’s Economic Census, and BEA ’s Int ernational Trans actions Accounts; the Cens us Bureau’s Ann ual Retail Tra de Survey , Service Annual Survey , Quarterly Services Survey , and Monthly Reta il Tra de Survey ; and the Bureau of Labor Sta tistic s’ Consum er Price Indexes (CPIs). Ta bles 5.A (PC E for goods) and 5.B (PCE for servi ces) following the main text summ arize the source data a nd estimating methods tha t are used to prepare t he curre nt- dollar benc hmark, nonb enchmark, and curre nt qu arterly estimates and the quantity a nd price e stimates for the categorie s of PCE as sho wn by ty pe of produ ct in NIP A table group 2.4. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Benchmark-ye ar estimates The source da ta used for the PCE estimates are complete only for “benchm ark” years— that is, years in w hich the benc hmark I-O a ccounts are used to e stablish the level of PCE and of its compone nts du ring a comprehensive update. The I-O accounts show the domestic output of each commodi ty and its di sposition —either as interme diate consumption by indust ries or as",
  "103": "CHAPTER 5: PERSONA L CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES 5-8 purchase s by fin al users, including consum ers. In the I-O accounts, PCE is p resente d as the sum of deta iled c ommodities—g oods and services—pu rchase d by persons.8 These commoditi es are then groupe d into the PCE categorie s shown in the NIPA tables.9 Two m ethods are use d in prep aring the benc hmark estimates of PCE: commodi ty- flow and di rect estimation. Direc t estimates are ma de for the PCE categorie s that, by def inition, are purchased only by persons: food furnish ed to e mployee s (including the military a nd food produce d and consum ed on farms), standard clothing issued to military per sonne l, net expe nditu res abroa d by U.S. residents, the rental value of owner- and tena nt-occupied dw ellings, services of workers employed by house holds, hea lth insu rance, a nd expe nse of ha nding li fe insurance a nd pe nsion pl ans. In addition, direc t estimates are made f or expe nditu res in the United State s by nonre sidents—whi ch include per sonal, busin ess, and government expe nditu res a nd which are subtracted in th eir entirety in determining PCE. F or most PCE categorie s, purchase s by persons are e stimated using the commodi ty-flow method (see the section “Commodi ty-flow m ethod” in Chapter 4). Generally , this m ethod begins with the value of domestic output base d on da ta from the Economic Census —su ch as manufac turers’ shipm ents for most goods, revenue for utilitie s, receipts for most s ervices, and commissions for securitie s brokerage.10 Next, the dom estic supply of each c ommodi ty—the amount available for domestic consumption— is estimated by adding imports and subt racting exports and inve ntory change . Then, this supp ly, denominate d in producer s’ pri ces, is allocated among dome stic purchas ers. The v alue of consum er purchase s is th en converted from producers’ prices to p urchasers’ p rices by adding whol esale marg ins and taxes, transporta tion costs, and retail margins and taxes.11 For some categorie s, variations of this method are used. For new motor ve hicles and for motor vehicle fuels, the domestic supply is converte d to purchasers’ prices and then a llocated a mong p ersons, busin ess, and government based on trade source data. For electricity a nd for natural ga s, residential reve nue data provi de direct estimates of purchase s by persons. For pres cription d rugs, retail and hea lth services sale s from the Economic Census are allocated to PC E using Cens us Burea u data on sales by cla ss of c ustom er. For purchased m eals and beverage s (excluding school s ales), food services sales from the Economic Census are a llocated to PC E by ty pe of eating place. 8 For m ore information on the preparation of the I-O benc hmark accounts, s ee U.

  "104": "CHAPTER 5: PERSONA L CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES 5-9 Nonbenchmark-year estimates In ye ars oth er than the benc hmark years, the PCE estimates are ma inly prepare d using indicator serie s to represe nt the pattern of expe nditu res (see the section “Int erpolation and extra polation using an indi cator series” in Chapter 4). The e stimates for most categorie s of PCE goods are prepare d usi ng the retail control m ethod. The estimates for the rema ining categ ories— motor vehicles; food furnish ed to e mployees ; food produced and consum ed on farms; tob acco; standard clothing issued to mi litary p ersonn el; motor vehicle fuels, lub ricants, and fluids; and net expe nditu res abroa d by U.S. residents—are prepare d separately (see ta bles 5.A a nd 5. B; for motor vehicles and motor vehicle fuels, see also the techni cal not e). The retail control m ethod provide s the indicator series use d in int erpolating a nd extra polating the total for most goods, and it p rovide s the “cont rol tota l” to which the categorie s included in the retail control group m ust sum. This m ethod is i mplemented as follows; for a genera l illustra tion of this m ethod, s ee the section “Reta il control m ethod” in Chapter 4: 1. The estimate of total PCE for most goods is deriv ed by extra polation from the benc hmark- year e stimate using a reta il control tota l of sales by most kinds of busine ss from the annual retail trade survey. 2. The estimates for prescription d rugs are prepared by extra polation using data from IQVIA. 3. The estimates for audio discs , tapes, vinyl, and permanent digital downloads are prepared by extrapolation using data from the Recording Industry Association of America. 4. The estimates for the rest of the deta iled PCE categories are prepare d by extra polation using estimates of retail sales by corre sponding produ ct lines that, in tu rn, are base d on c ommodity sales data from the most recent Economic Census . For goods boug ht at grocery stores, the Economic Census allocations are update d annually through 2021 using reta il point-of-sa le scanner da ta from Circana, Inc .12 For goods boug ht at electroni cs stores, the allocations are updated through 2022 using retail point-of-sa le scanner da ta from Circana.13 For goods boug ht at electronic shopping and mail order retailers , the allocations are update d using annual merchandise line sales from the Census Bureau E -commerce Report . 5. The expe nditu res estimates for the categorie s in st ep 4 are adjust ed proportion ately so th at their sum plus the expe nditures for prescription d rugs and for audio discs , tapes, vinyl, and permanent digital downloads is equal to the retail control total in ste p 1. A variety of sources a nd me thods are used to c onstruc t the indicator serie s for the PCE services categorie s. For many servi ces, the servi ce annua l survey is the prim ary da ta sou rce. Current quarterly and month ly estimates The seasonally adjusted curre nt doll ar quarterly a nd monthl y estimates f or most PCE categorie s are prepare d by using seasonally adjusted indi cator series to extra polate from the annua l estimates. Most goods categories are estimated by the retail control m ethod using data on 12 See Eugene P. Seskin and Sh elly Smith, “Annual Revision of the National Income and Product A ccounts,” Survey 88 (August 2008): 18. 13 See Clinton P.

F or many servi ces categorie s, the indicator serie s are base d on da ta from the Ce nsus Bureau’s Quart erly Servi ces Survey. For the rema ining categorie s, the curre nt estimates are extra polated base d on other source da ta or on ju dgme ntal tren ds. In genera l, the real-doll ar series for these categorie s are extra polated using the rate of change in popul ation and a projected rate of change in real per capita consumption base d on the re sults of the most recent NIPA annual update . The real-doll ar estimates are then conver ted to curre nt dol lars using the a ppropria te monthly price indexes. T he not seasonally adjusted estimates are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted estimates, using the not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators . Quantity and price estimates The estimates of quantitie s purchase d, or real sp ending , for most of the deta iled PCE categorie s are prepare d by deflation. In this method, the quantitie s are calculate d by dividing the curre nt-doll ar va lue of the compone nt by an a ppropria te price index (with the referen ce-year value set to 100). For most PCE categorie s, the closest matc hing price index is a consum er price index or indexes. In addition, the quantity estimates for some d etailed compone nts are prepare d by quantity extra polation or by di rect valuation. (For descriptions of the three me thods, s ee the section “Estim ates for deta iled c ompone nts” in Chapter 4.) The aggrega te PCE measure s are calculated from the deta iled compone nts as chain-type quantity a nd price indexes (for informa tion about the se calculations, s ee the s ection “Estim ates for NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 4).

The housing stock provide s a flow of housi ng servi ces th at are c onsum ed by persons who re nt their housing and by persons who own the housing they occupy (ref erred to a s “owner-occupants”). In the NIPAs, own er- occupa nts are treated a s owni ng unincorpo rated e nterprises that provide housing services to themselves in the form of the rental value of their dw ellings.22 Thus, PCE for housing services in cludes both the monetary re nts paid by tenants and an imput ed rental value for owner-occ upied dw ellings (measure d as the in come the homeowner c ould ha ve received if the house had bee n rented to a tena nt).23 This trea tment is d esigned to m ake PCE (and GDP) invariant to wh ether the house is rented by a la ndlord to a tena nt or is liv ed in by the homeowner.24 Measures of PCE for the services provided by tenant -occupied housing are based on data on rent paid by tenants and data on the number of tenant -occupied units, both from the American Community Survey’s (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) .25 For measures of PCE for the services provided by owner -occupied housing, estimates of rent per unit are derived using the rental equivalence approach, adjusted to include an “owner premium,” b ased on the same ACS data. Within nonfarm properties, the NIPAs provide separa te estimates for owner- occupie d per mane nt-site dwellings, own er-occupi ed mobile homes, tenant-occupied permane nt-site dwellings, and tenant-occupi ed mobile homes. Within farm properties, separate estimates are prepared for tenant -occupied dwellings and owner -occupied dwellings.26 22 This treatment is consistent with that of the in ternational System of National A ccoun ts (SNA): “Households th at own the dwe llings they occupy are formally tr eated as owners of unincor porated enterprises that produce housing serv ices consum ed by those same ho useholds” See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008 : 6:117 at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/SNA2008.asp . 23 The income earned from the rental of housing, including the provision of owner -occupied housing services, is reflected in the NIPA measure of rental income of persons. For more information on this measure, see “ Chapter 12: Rental Income of Persons .” 24 Accord ing to the SNA, “The r a tio of owner-o ccupied to rented dwellings can vary significantly…so both international and in ter-tem poral comparisons of the production and consumption of housing se rvices could be dist orted if no imputa tion were made for the value of own- account h ousing serv ices.” ( SNA 2008 : 6.34). 25 BEA uses “1 -year” ACS data; that is, data that are collected over 12 months of a calendar year. 1 -year data are collected for areas with populations of 65,000 or more. The ACS provides both “1 -year” estimates “5-year” estimates (collected over five calendar years ). For more information on the ACS single - and multi- year estimates, see C hapter 3 of the Census Bureau’s “ Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know .” 26 The A CS identifies farms as properties with agricultural sales greater than $1,000 per year.",

Payme nts for utilitie s also excluded be cause they are alread y account ed for elsewhere in PCE. Rents per unit are weighted averages of actual observations of tenant -occupied unit rents that are covered by the ACS, adjusted to exclude utilities where necessary. For owner -occupied dwellings, the rental value is estimated using the rental equivalence approach paired with an owner premium. That is, for each year and Public Use Microdata Area ( PUMA ) in the ACS, a stratified rental equivalence for owner units is imputed by regressing tenant rents, from which utilities have been excluded, on characteristics of tenant units reported in the ACS. 27 Characteristics include structure type, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and age of structure. ACS data on the same characteristics of owner -occupied units are then applied to the parameter estimates from the tenant regressions to calculate the imputed rental value for owner -occupied units . These imputations are done at the unit level. The imputed rental values for owner -occupied units are then adjusted to include an “owner premium” to adjust for quality differences between owner -occupied and tenant -occupied units. The owner premium is particularly important for accurately reflecting the value of housing services for high-valued homes , as they are not well - represented in rental markets. The adjustment generally results in a higher rent per unit for a given combination of housing characteristics compared with a tenant -occupied unit. For the most recent year, estimates are released before the ACS data become availab le; consequently, measures of rent per unit are judgmentally extrapolated using recent years’ growth trends and any relevant topical information. Numb er of housing units For annual estimates except the most recent year, for all tenure categories, the number of housing units are derived from ACS observations and aggregated to the national level from PUMA data. Where the ACS classifies a housing unit as a mobile unit with agricultural sales greater than $1,000, BEA classifies that unit as owner - or tenant -occupied farm housing. Mobile units are defined to include any housing unit used as a principal 27A PUMA is a Census Bureau statistical geographic area defined for the dissemination of PUMS data .

Fixed assets consist of structures, equipment, and intellectual property products that are used in the production of goods and services . PFI encompasses the creation of new productive assets , the improvement of existing assets , and the replacement of worn out or obsolete assets. The PFI estimates serve as an indicator of the willingness of private businesses and nonprofit institutions to expand their production capacity and as an indicator of the demand for housing . Thus, movements in PFI serve as a barometer of confidence in, and support for, future economic growth. PFI also provides comprehensive information on the composition of business fixed investment. Thus, for example, it can be used to assess the penetration of new technology. In addition, the investment estimates are the building blocks for BEA’s estimate s of capital stock , which are used in measur ing rates of return on capital and in analyzing multifactor productivity. The PFI estimates are an integral part of the U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts that provide s a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “ Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts ”). The PFI estimates are also a primary element of BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts. 1 1 For a description of the methodology for BEA’s estimates of the stocks and depreciation of fixed assets and of the investment flows used to derive them, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States 1925 –97, September 2003.",
  "166": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-2 Definitions and Concepts P FI is a measure of the additions to, and replacements of, th e U.S. stock of private fixed assets . As noted in Chapter 2, fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in the production process —that is, in the production of other goods (including other fixed assets) or of services —for more than 1 year. Table 6.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from , PFI. The bulk of PFI consists of capital expenditures by private bus iness —including expenditures on new structures, equipment, and intellectual property products ; net transactions in used assets; and own -account production (production by a business for its own use) of structures , equipment, and intellectual property products . 2 PFI also includes capital expenditures by nonprofit institutions serving households , and it includes capital expenditures for the acquisition of new residential structures and for improvements to existing residential structures by households in their capacity as owner -occupants .3 In the NIPAs, the construction of a new house (excluding the value of the unimproved land) is treated as an investment, the ownership of the house (regardless of whether the residence is owner - or tenant -occupied) is treated as a productive business enterprise, and a service is assumed to flow over its economic life from the house to the occupant. 4 However, as noted in Chapter 2, purchases of durable goods by persons are treated as personal consumption expenditures rather than as capital expenditures . 2 In the NIPAs, private bus iness consists of all corporate and noncorporate businesses that are organized for profit, other entities that produce goods and services for sale at a price that is based on the costs of production , a nd certain other private entities that are treated as business in the NIPAs. These other entities include mutual financial institutions, private noninsured pension funds, cooperatives, nonprofit orga nizations that primarily serve business (that is, entities cla ssified a s nonprofit by the Internal Revenue Service in determining income tax liability), federal reserve banks, and federally sponsored credit agencies. 3 Capital expenditures by government enterprises are included in gross investment by government. 4 This treatment is consistent with that of the international System of National Accounts (SNA): “Households that own the dwellings they occupy are formally treated as owners of unincorporated enterprises that produce housing services consumed by those same households.” See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008 : 6:117 at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/SNA2008.asp .

Using business-tax -accounting practices for depreciable assets as a guide, all structures are capitalized in the NIPAs, and equipment commodities are capitalized if they meet all three of the following criteria:",
  "168": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-4 • The commodity must have a useful life of more than 1 year, • The commodity must not be an integral part of a structure or included in the value of that structure (for example, an elevator ), and • The commodity, if purchased by a business, would be charged to a capital account under normal accounting procedures. However, there are certain cases for which the NIPA treatment differs from that used in business -tax-accounting . For example, the exploration and drilling costs associated with unsuccessful drilling activities ( “dry” holes ) are treated as expenses by the petroleum industry but as investment in the NIPAs. In addition, business -accounting practices may differ from one industry to another, from one period to another , or from one type of asset to another. For example, some businesses may expense the purchase of certain types of software , while others may capitalize it; for consistency, all software purchases are treated as investment in the NIPAs . These capitalization rules and the selection of commodi ties that are treated as fixed assets are reviewed and updated as part of the preparation of BEA’s b enchmar k input -output (I -O) a ccounts and of comprehensive update s of the NIPAs. As part of the 2013 comprehensive NIPA revision, BEA fully integrated the 2007 benchmark input - output accounts and introduced several substantial changes that expanded the definition of fixed assets. First, BEA began treating expenditures by business, government, and nonprofit institutions serving households on research and development as fixed investment.5 Second, it began treating expenditures by business and nonprofit institutions serving households on entertainment, literary, and other artistic originals as fixed investment. These changes recognize that these intangible assets have ownership rights, are long-lasting, and are used in the production process. Investment in research and development and in entertainment originals, along with that in software (which has been treated as a fixed asset since the 1999 comprehensive NIPA revision), is shown in the NIPAs in the subcategory “intellectual property products” in nonresidential fixed investment. 6 Also as part of the 2013 comprehensive update, BEA expanded the ownership transfer costs of residential fixed assets to include all of the nonfinancial ownership transfer costs that are associated with the purchase of a residential asset (such as title insurance; title, abstract, and attorney fees; p ayments for state and local government documentary and stamp taxes; and payments for surveys and engineering services). 7 As part of the 2018 comprehensive update, BEA began including the value of the return to fixed capital (that is, capital services) into estimates of private fixed investment in own-account software and in own -account R&D beginning with 2007. The improved treatment is consistent with international standards and will provide more 5 The treatment of these expenditures as investment provides another example in which economic accounting differs from business accounting; see Dylan G.

The N IPA measure of PFI records capital expenditures on structures in the United States regardless of whether the structure is U.S. -owned or foreign-owned. 8 It records capital expenditures on equipment and software in the United States regardless of whether the equipment and software are domestically produced or imported. In contrast , capital expenditures by U.S. residents on structures in other countries and U.S. exports of equipment and software are excluded from the PFI measure. In the NIPAs, t he broadest measure of PFI is gross private fixed investmen t. It is measured without deduction of consumption of fixed capital (CFC), which is a measure of capital used up in production. Gross private fixed investment less CFC equals net private fixed investment . Gross private fixed investment comprises nonresidential fixed investment in structures , equipment , and intellectual property products and residential fixed investment in structures and equipment. Nonresidential structures consists of new construction—i ncluding own-account construction; 9 improvements to existing structures ;10 expenditures on new mobile structures ; expenditures on mining exploration, shafts , and wells ;11 brokers’ commissions on sales of structures ;12 and net purchases of used structures by private business es and by nonprofit institutions from government agencies.13 In addition, it includes equipment that is considered to be an integral part of the structure (such as plumbing, heating, and electrical systems). Nonresidential e quipment consists of purchases by private businesses and by nonprofit institutions of new equipment (such as machinery, furniture, and motor vehicles) that meet s the above definition of a fixed asset . It also includes dealers’ margins on sales of used equipment to busine sses and to nonprofit institutions; net purchases of used equipment from government agencies, from persons, and f rom the rest of the world; and own-account production of equipment . It is measured net of the value of worn out equipment sold for scrap. 8 Ownership of a structure in a country signifies a long -term economic interest in that country, a nd thus the owner is considered a resident of that country. 9 For nonresidential fixed investment, own -account construction consists of the value of construction materials supplied by the project owner and the value of the labor supplied by the owner’s own construction employees assigned to the project. 10 Improvements to nonresidential structures are included with new construction but are not separately identified. 11 In principle, mining exploration should be classified as part of intellectual property products, but currently these expenditures cannot be separately identified due to source data limitations. 12 These commissions are considered part of the total price paid by the purchaser for the structure and thus are counted as part of the value of investment. 13 These transactions are included so that private and government ownership of the net stock of fixed assets is properly recorded; by definition, such transfers net to zero and do not affect gross domestic product.",
  "170": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-6 Nonresidential intellectual property products consists of purchase s and own- account production of software, of research and development (R&D), and of entertainment, literary, and artistic originals. R&D includes depreciation on fixed assets used to produce R&D. Entertainment originals includes theatrical movies, long -lived television programs, books, music, and other artistic originals that are used to produce copies for the public. Residential structures consists of new construction of permanent -site single - family and multifamily housing units, improvements (additions, alterations, and major structural replacements) to housing units ,14 expenditures on manufactured homes, brokers’ commissions and other ownership transfer costs15 on the sale of residential property, and net purchases of used structures from government agencies. Residential structures also includes some types of equipment (such as heating and air conditioning equipment) that are built into the structure. Residential equipment consists of equipment, such as furniture or household appliances, that is purchased by landlords for rental to tenants. Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2 , the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy. PFI represents the final demand for structures , for equipment , and for intellectual property products by private businesses and by other entities that are treated similarly to businesses in the NIPAs. In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, PFI appears in the Domestic Income and Product Account (account 1) as the dominant component of gross private domestic investment and in the Domestic Capital Account (a ccount 6) as the dominant component of gross domestic investment. In the NIPAs, PFI is shown by type of product classification rather than by industry classification. Annual estimates of gross fixed investment and net fixed investment (that is, investment less CFC ) by major type are provided in NIPA table group 5.2. PFI by type is presented in NIPA table group 5.3.

They include construction of additional housing units in existing residential structures, finishing of basements and attics, remodeling of kitchens and bathrooms, and the addition of swimming pools and garages. They include major replacements —such as new roofs, water heaters, furnaces, and central air conditioners —that prolong the expected life of the structure or add to its value; routine maintenance and repair work is not included. For residential fixed investment, own -account construction (“do-it-yourself” projects) consists of the value of the materials supplied only and does not include the value of the labor supplied by the property owner. 15 Ownership transfer costs includes title insurance; title, abstract, and attorney fees; payments for state and local government documentary and stamp taxes; and payments for surveys and engineering services .

In particular, the detailed estimates are more likely to be based on judgmental trends, on trends in the higher -level category, or on less reliable source data. The underlying detail tables for PFI consist of tables that provide quarterly estimates that are in the same format as, and consistent with, the annu al estimates shown in NIPA table groups 5.2, 5.4 , 5.5, and for the software estimate s shown in table 5.6.16 Because of data limitations, BEA does not p ublish underlying detail for the other intellectual property products. In addition, estimates of PFI by industry and by legal form of organization are presented as part of BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts.17 Overview of Source Data and Estimating M ethods As described earlier, the NIPA estimates, including those for PFI , are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “ Chapter 3 : Principal Source Data ”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “ Chapter 4: Estimating Methods ”). For PFI, the estimates are based on government statistical reports, primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau but also from other federal government agencies, and on reports from private organizations, such as trade associations. The following are among the principal source data used for the PFI estimates: BEA’s benchmark I-O a ccounts , which are primarily based on the Census Bureau’s E conomic Census, and BEA’s International Transactions Accounts; the Census Bureau’s annual and monthly S urvey of M anufactur ers, monthly construction statistics, monthly foreig n trade data, the S ervice Annual Survey, and the Quarterly Services Survey; the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ (BLS) monthly Current Employment Statistics, Producer Price Indexes (PPIs) and Import Price Indexes ; and National Science Foundation’s (NSF) surveys of research and development and innovation. Table 6.A (investment in structures) , table 6.B (investment in equipment), and table 6.C (investment in intellectual property products) at the end of this chapter summar ize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current- dollar benchmark, nonbenchmark, and current quarterly estimates and the quantity and price indexes for the detailed categories shown by type in NIPA table groups 5.4 , 5.5, and 5.6. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. 16 See “ Access Underlying Detail Tables ” in BEA’s “Interactive Data,” at www.bea.gov . 17 See “ Fixed Assets” on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov .",
  "173": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-9 Benchmark -year esti mates For benchmark years, BEA’s b enchmark I -O accounts are used to establish the levels of PFI and its components. The I -O accounts show the domestic output of each commodity and its disposition—either as intermediate consumption by industries or as purchases for final use, including business investment. In the I -O accounts, PFI is presented as the sum of detailed commodities purchased by business for final use. 18 These commodities are then grouped into the PFI categories shown in the NIPA tables.19 For structures, the benchmark I -O estimates are primarily based on detailed value - put-in-place data from the Census Bureau’s m onthly survey of c onstruction spending. The “v alue of construction put in place ” is defined as the value of construction installed or erected at the construction site during a given period, regardless of when the work on the project was started or completed, when the structure was sold or delivered, or when payment for the structure was made. 20 BEA adjusts the value -put-in-place data to account for coverage gaps that are implied by compari ng these data with t hose from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census .21 In addition, BEA uses data from other government sources and from trade sources in estimating the following structures categories: mobile structures; oil and natural gas well drilling and exploration; other mining exploration, shafts, and wells; residential manufactured homes; brokers ’ commissions on the sale of nonresidential structures and brokers’ commissions and other ownership transfer costs on the sale of residential structures ; and net purchases of used structures from government agencies. For equipment, the benchmark estimates are largely prepared using the commodity-flow method (for a general description of this method, see “Commodity-flow method” in Chapter 4 ). This method , which is implemented in its most complete form in preparing the benchmark I-O accounts , generally begins with a value of domestic output (principally manufacturers’ shipments) based on detailed data from the Economic Census . Next, the domestic supply of each commodity—the amount available for domestic consumption—is estimated by adding imports and subtracting exports, both based on the Census Bureau ’s international trade d ata. The domestic supply is then allocated among domestic purchasers —business, government, and consumers. For most commodities, the allocation of purchases to business, and the subsequent allocation of 18 For more infor mation on the preparation of the I -O benchmark accounts, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Ana lysis, Concepts and Methods of the U.S. Input -Output Accounts , April 2009, available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov . 19 A complete listing of the commodities underlying each category of PFI in equipment is available as part of an FAQ available on BEA’s website: “ Are more detailed estimates available for investment in private equipment beyond what is presented in the underlying detail Table 5.5.5U? ” ( see the section on “PEQ Bridge”). 20 Value put in place is measured as the sum of the cost of materials installed or erected; cost of labor supplied by contractors and by project owners; and a proportionate share of the cost of construction equipment rental, contractors’ profit, cost of arch itectur al and engineering work, miscellaneous overhead and office costs chargeable to the project on the owners’ books, and interest and taxes paid during construction. 21 These adjustments are for own -account construction, for small projects that are excluded from the value - put-in-place data, and for nonresidential improvements.",

In a few cases, the allocation is entirely to final use (for example, motor vehicles ) or to intermediate use (for example, semiconductors).22 The commodity -flow calculations also include estimates of trade margins and transportation costs23 and estimates of transactions in used equipment (see the technical note at the end of this chapter). The following estimates are prepared directly rather than by commodity flow: installation costs for communication equipment, industrial process design costs, and expenditures for nuclear fuel rods, and for scrap metal. For intellectual property products, the benchmark -year estimates for purchased software are based on industry recei pts data from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census . The estimates for own-account software are measured as the sum of production costs , including the value of capital services (which includes depreciation) . The estimates are based on BLS data on occupational employment and wages , on Economic Census data, and on BEA -derived measures of capital services .24 The benchmark -year estimates for R&D are based on NSF survey data, and the estimates for entertainment originals are based on revenue data from the Economic Census. (For more information on the estimates for intellectual property products, see the technical note at the end of this chapter.) Nonbenchmark-year estimates The estimates of structures for nonbenchmark years are generally prepared at the same level of detail as those for benchmark years. For most components, the estimates are prepared by using the monthly construction spending data as an indicator series to extrapolate the benchmark -year estimates (see “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in Chapter 4 ) and by assuming that the relationships underlying the benchmark estimates remain unchanged. For example, the coverage adjustments made to the construction spending data for the benchmark year are assumed to be a constant proportion for periods after the benchmark year until the next benchmark estimates are available. The estimates of equipment f or nonbenchmark years are generally prepared at a more aggregate level of detail than those for benchmark years , primarily because data on shipments are not available for the detailed product groupings. For most components , the estimates are prepared using an abbreviated form of the commodity-flow method that accommodates the available source data. For years except the most recent year , the primary source for domestic manufacturers’ sh ipments is the Census Bureau’s A nnual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) , which collects data by product class ; for the most recent 22 For a description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates for new motor vehicles, see the technical note in “ Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures .” 23 Trade margins measure the cost of marketing goods from producers to final purchasers, including markups by wholesalers and retailers. Transportation costs measure the costs of carrying goods by rail, truck, water, air, and liquid and gas pipelines. 24 For more infor mation, see Jason W. Chute, Stephanie H.

For most components, estimates of exports and imports (based on international trade data) , government purchases (based on Federal agency administrative data and on Census Bureau surveys of state and local government finance) , and inventories (based on Census Bureau surveys and on IRS tabulations of business tax returns) are available. The estimates of the distributions of purchases among consumers, business final use, and business intermediate purchases are largely based on the benchmark relationships. For intellectual property products, the nonbenchmark-year estimates for purchased software are based on receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey (SAS) , and the estimates of own -account software are primarily based on BLS data on employment and wages. The nonbenchmark-year estimates for R&D are based on NSF survey data and SAS receipts data, and the estimates for entertainment originals are primarily based on SAS revenue data. (For more information on the estimates for intellectual property products, see the technical note at the end of this chapter.) Current q uarterly estimates The seasonally adjusted c urrent -dollar quarterly estimates —that is, th e estimates for the quarters that have not yet been subject to an annual update —for most categories of structures are prepared by extrapolatio n, using the same data sources as those used for the nonbenchmark-year estimates. For net purchases of used structures, the current quarterly estimates are based on judgmental trends. For petroleum and natural gas exploration and drilling, the quantity estimates for the current quarter are prepared first by extrapolating the quantity annual series using indicator series ; these estimates are then convert ed (reflat ed) to current -dollar values using quarterly price indexes. The current quarterly estimates for equipment are prepared by the abbreviated commodity-flow method at the same aggregated level and based on the same data source as that used for the most -recent -year estimates (figure 6.1). For intellectual property products, the current quarterly estimates for purchased software are based on receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Services (QSS) when available; when they are not available, the estimates are judgmentally trended by BEA . Estimates of own -account software are based on BLS current employment statistics . The current quarterly estimates for R&D are based on company reports and receipts data from the QS S when available; when unavailable, estimates are judgmentally trended by BEA . The estimates for entertainment originals are based on QS S revenue data when available and are otherwise judgmentally trended by BEA . 25 (For more information on the estimates for intellectual property products, see the technical note at the end of this chapter.) 25 Beca use of data limita tions, BEA does not publish current quarterly estimates for individual research a nd development and entertainment -original components.",

The abbreviated procedure for preparing the current quarterly estimate for a typical equipment component may be summarized as follows : 1. Manufacturers’ industry shipments are taken from the monthly Survey of Manufacturers’ Shipments, Inventories, and Orders . 2. The shipments by industry are converted to private equipment shipments by product, using information on the relationship between industry shipments and product shipments from the most recent year’s ASM . 3. Exports are subtracted from, and imports are added to , the product shipments , yielding an estimate of domestic supply. The d ata on exports and imports are from the Census Bureau . 4. No attempt is made to estimate the effects of quarterly inventory changes on the commodity flow for any commodities. 5. Business i ntermediate purchases are subtracted from domestic supply, primarily based on ratios derived from the detailed benchmark I -O estimates , and consumer purchases and government purchases are subtracted, primarily based on information from the most recent annual estimates.

Quantity and price estimates The estimates of quantities purchased, or real spending, for most of the detailed PFI categories are prepared by deflati on. Under this method, the quantities are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by an “appropriate” price index (with the reference year set equal to 100) . For petroleum and natural gas exploration and drilling, the quantity estimates are prepared by direct valuation (see the technical note). (For a general description of these methods, see “Estimates for detailed components” in Chapter 4 .) For structures, a wide variety of price indexes from public and private sources are used as deflators . For some components of nonresidential structures , quality -adjusted output price measures, such as PPIs, are not available, and BEA uses combinations of input -cost measures and output -cost measures in an effort to capture productivity and quality changes.26 For m ost equipment categories, detailed PPIs and import price indexes from BLS are used. For intellectual property products, a variety of price indexes are used (for more information, see the technical note at the end of this chapter). The aggregate PFI measures are calculated from the detailed components as chain -type quantity and price indexes (for information about t hese calculations, see “Estimates for NIPA aggregates ” in Chapter 4 ). BEA also prepares measures of real PFI and its components in a dollar -denominated form, designated “chained-dollar” estimates (see “Chained -dollar measures” in Chapter 4).27 26 For more infor mation, see Paul R. Lally, “ BEA Briefing: How BEA Accounts for Investment in Private Structures ,” S urvey 89 (February 2009): 11. 27 BEA does not provide chained -dolla r mea sures (a s distinct from cha in -weighted indexes and percent changes) for computers, which are affected by highly volatile changes in prices and quantities (see J. Steven Landefeld, Brent R. Moulton, and Cindy M. Vojte ch, “ Chained -Dollar Indexes: Issues, Tips on Their Use, and Upcoming Changes ,” S urvey 83 (November 2003): 16.",

  "199": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-35 Technical Note: Special E stimates This section provides additional detail on the sources and methods used to estimate the following key components of private fixed investment (PFI): new single - family structures, used equipment, and intellectual property products . New single -family structures This PFI component measures the construction of fully detached units and of other units (such as rowhouses and townhouses) that are separated from adjacent units by a ground-to -roof wall and that do not share heating/air conditioning systems or other interstructural public utilities (such as water supply, power supply, or sewage disposal lines). The value of new single -family construction excludes the value of land, marketing costs, closing costs, and movable appliances. The annual and quarterly estimates of investment in new single -family structures are based on the Census Bureau’s monthly construction statistics on the value of new construction put in place for one -unit structures. The Census Bureau determines the const ruction cost of new single -family houses started each month using data from its monthly Survey of Construction. Construction costs are estimated separately for units built to be sold or rented and for units built by an owner or for an owner on contract. The estimated cost of all single -family units started is then distributed into monthly value put in place by applying fixed 12 -month patterns of monthly construction progress. 28 The patterns vary somewhat depending on the particular month the unit is started; in general, the progress pattern assumes that about 16 percent of the project is completed in the first month, about 23 percent in the second month, about 20 percent in the third month, about 15 percent in the fourth month, about 10 percent in the fifth month, and the remainder is distributed in declining amounts over the succeeding 7 months. For the advance current quarterly estimate, only 2 months of value -put-in-place data are available. BEA estimates the value p ut in place for the third month, primarily based on data on housing starts for that month and on the Census Bureau’s construction progress pattern. Quantity estimates . The estimates of investment in real new single -family structures are prepared by deflation, using the Census Bureau price index for new one - family houses under construction. 28 For more information, see “ Construction Methodology ” at www.census.gov .",
  "200": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-36 Used equipment Aside from trade margins and commissions earned by the services of brokers and dealers, transactions in secondhand fixed assets among sectors do not reflect current production activity and so do not affect gross domestic product. However, these transfers of assets between sectors are recorded in the NIPAs so that the estimates of fixed investment are consistent with the estimates of the net stock of private fixed assets. Moreover, the estimates of saving by the individual sectors of the economy must reflect purchases of used equipment as well as purchases of new equipment. Thus, net purchases of used equipment by private business from households, governments, and the rest of the world are added to investment in equipment and software and are subtracted (as net sales) from personal consumption expenditures, from government fixed investment, and from net exports, respectively. Sales of used motor vehicles by business to persons account for the bulk of these intersectoral transactions; thus in the NIPAs, total n et purchases of equipment by private business is negative. (For a detailed description of the methodology used to prepare the NIPA estimates for net purchases of used motor vehicles, see the technical note in “ Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures ”). For benchmark years, transactions in used equipment by commodity (other than motor vehicles) are derived as the sum of the trade margins on sales of used equipment and of net sales of used equipment between business and the other sectors of the economy. The trade margins are estimated using information from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census . Net sales between business and persons are also from the Economic Census . Net sales between business and the federal government are from federal agency source data, p rimarily from the Government Services Administration; net sales between business and state and local governments are from the Census Bureau’s census of governments. Net exports of used equipment are based on Census Bureau foreign trade data. For nonbenchmark years other than the most recent year, net exports are based on foreign trade data, net sales between business and government are from federal agency source data and from the annual survey of government finances, and trade margins and net sales between business and other sectors are prepared by extrapolation using the change in new nonresidential equipment. For the most recent year and for the current quarters, the estimates by component are prepared by extrapolation using the change in new nonresidential equipment for that component. Quantity estimates . For all years and for current quarters, the estimates of real net transactions in used equipment by component are prepared by deflating the current -dollar estimates using the component deflators listed in table 6.B.",
  "201": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-37 Intellectual property products This PFI component comprises purchases and own-account production of software, expenditures for research and development (R&D), and expenditures on entertainment, literary, and other artistic originals. Most intellectual property products are not sold in an open market, so other valuation methods must be used in measuring the investment in these assets. Thus, investment in own-account software and in R&D is measured as the sum of production costs , and investment in entertainment originals is measured using net present valuation. Software Investment in s oftware comprises purchases of prepackaged software and of customized software from companies that are primarily engaged in software development and of expenditures for the own -account production of new or significantly enhanced software that the business enterprise develops in-house. Purchased software For benchmark years, the current -dollar estimates for purchases of prepackaged software and for custom software are based on industry receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census and are derived using the commodity-flow method (for a general description of this method, see “Commodity-flow method” in Chapter 4). For nonbenchmark years, the estimates are based on industry receipts data from the Census Bureau’s S ervice Annual Survey and are derived using an abbreviated commodity-flow method (described earlier in this chapter). For the current quarterly estimates, the “second” and “third” estimate s are based on revenue data from the QSS, and the “advance” estimate is based on judgmental trends. Quantity estimates .

In addition, wages are reduced by subtracting the portion of wages paid by the “computer systems design and related services industry” for the production of custom software for sale; these sales are already included in the PFI estimates of custom software. The data on employment by industry and the data on wages by occupation are from the BLS occupational employment and wage statistics survey. The estimates of nonwage compensation are based on relationships between wage and nonwage compensation derived from NIPA data by industry. The estimates of input costs are based on relationships between intermediate inputs and compensation that are derived primarily from the Census Bureau’s E conomic Census. The estimates of expenditures for own-account software for the current quarters are prepared by extrapolation, using an index of employment in four industries for which computer -related occupations account for a relatively high portion of total employment.

For benchmark years and for nonbenchmark years, the estimates of private fixed investment in R&D are primarily based on R&D expenditures data from three National Science Foundation (NSF) annual surveys: the Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey, the Annual Business Survey, and the Higher Education Research and Development Survey. These surveys are based on R&D by performer, but they also collect data on the funder of the R&D, and BEA uses these data to put R&D investment on an ownership basis . (Federal purchases and grants of R&D are both treated as investment by the federal sector because the federal government receives economic benefits and because of the difficulty in distinguishing ownership between the funder and the performer of the R&D in the source data .) In addition to the NSF data, revenue data from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey (SAS) are used in the R&D calculations. BEA then further adjusts the data for coverage, for scope, and for alignment with NIPA framework and concepts. These adjustments include (1) accounting for imported and exported R&D, (2) adding social science R&D, which is captured separately on the NSF su rveys, (3) converting depreciation for structures and equipment used to produce R&D to an economic cost basis, (4) reconciling the NSF data with data from the Census Bureau’s economic censes (only in benchmark years), (5) replacing NSF reported expenditure s for deprecation with BEA -derived capital services measures (which include depreciation) , 33 and (6) in certain cases, converting measures for purchased R&D from a cost-basis to a purchase -basis. For the most recent year, the estimates for business R&D investment are extrapolated based on R&D expenses reported by publicly traded companies on their annual financial statements , and on QSS industry receipts data on scientific research and development services . For nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISHs) , the estimates for universities and colleges are based on judgmental trend, and the estimates for other NPISHs are based on federal budget data on R&D outlays to NPISHs , QSS industry receipts data , and judgmental trends. For the current quarterly estimates, the “third” and “second” estimates for total business R&D are extrapolated based on R&D expenses from the quarterly financial reports of publicly traded companies, and on revenue data from the QSS. T he “advance” estimate is based on judgmental trends. The R&D estimates for both academic and nonacademic NPISH s are based on BLS current employment statistics on aggregate wages for the e ducation and h ealth industry. 34 was introduced in the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs: see “ Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts ,”: 14 –1 8. 33 For more information, see Chute, McCulla, and Smith (2018) . 34 Because of data limitations, BEA does not publish current quarterly estimates for individual R&D components. Current quarterly estimates for total business R&D are provided in NIPA table group 5.3.",
  "204": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-40 Quantity estimates . The estimates of real expenditures for R&D are prepared by deflation. For own-account R&D and for purchases from other businesses, nonacademic NPISHs, and state and local governments, the deflator is a Fisher -weighted price index of productivity-adjusted , input -cost based indexes for two specific industries: scientific research and development services, and all other private industries. The input -cost indexes are composed of wages, materials and supplies, economic depreciation, and other costs, and the weights for these cost components are derived from the NSF Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey. For purchases from academic institutions, the deflator is a productivity -adjusted, input -cost based index composed of university faculty and r esearch associates’ compensation, overhead, purchased services, materials and supplies, and economic depreciation, and the weights for these cost components are derived from the NSF Higher Education Research and Development Survey. Entertainment, literary, and artistic originals Entertainment, literary, and artistic originals consists of theatrical movies, long - lived television programs, books, music, and other miscellaneous entertainment (such as theatrical play scripts, greeting card designs, and commercial stock photography). 35 The production of entertainment originals may span several years. Theoretically, these costs should be recorded as investment when accrued; however, due to practical constraints, BEA records the value of the investment in the year the asset is released to the public. Because adequate information on production costs is not available for most entertainment originals, BEA estimates the value of these assets based on the net present value (NPV) of expected future royalties or other revenue obtained from these assets, net of any associated sales costs. 36 For each type of entertainment originals asset, the expected net cash flow of the producing industry is estimated using revenue and cost data from the Census Bureau’s E conomic Census and surveys, numerous trade sources, and other sources. BEA assumes a 7 -percent real discount rate for all asset types and applies an NPV adjustment factor, a ratio that represents the average NPV -to-current-year revenues in order to derive an estima te of investment in entertainment originals for that year. For benchmark years, the estimates for entertainment originals are based on product -level revenue detail from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census that is adjusted to remove nonartwork costs (which are recorded as current production costs). These data are then adjusted by applying BEA -generated investment ratios (net -present value factors) to derive the investment values. 37 35 The treatment of expenditures by business and nonprofit institutions serving households on entertai nment originals as fixed investment was introduced in the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs: see “ Pre view of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts ,” 18 –2 0. 36 The SNA discusses the use of NPV for estimating the value of assets; see SNA 2008 , 22, paragraph 2.60, 52, paragraph 3.137 -138); see also the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Handbook on Deriving Capital Measures of Intellectual Property Products , 18, 158 -159. 37 Based on research using trade sources, studies, and survey and Economic Census data, BEA estimates the following investment ratios for the five categories of entertainment originals assets: 51 percent of industry revenue for theatrical movies, 50 percent of industry revenue for music, 37 percent of industry",
  "205": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-41 First, total current-period revenue from licensing fees, merchandise sales, ticket sales, and other revenue generating activities for the industries producing the assets are estimated. Second, the value of sales costs —such as advertising, manufacturing of reproductions, and other marketing type costs —is subtracted from the total current period revenues to derive net revenue values that capture only the revenues earned on the intangible assets held by the business. Third, these net revenue values are adjusted further to only include the revenue from the release of new works ( that is, the “originals”), using the BEA -derived investment ratios .38 Finally, the NPV adjustment factor is applied to the net revenue value that has been adjusted by the investment ratio in order to derive the current-period investment value of the future revenue stream of these new works. For nonbenchmark years, the estimates for entertainment originals are derived by extrapolation, primarily based on revenue data for selected product lines from the Census Bureau’s S ervice Annual Survey. For the most recent year, the estimates for entertainment originals are derived by extrapolation, primarily based on revenue data from the QSS. For current quarterly estimates of total business entertainment originals, the “third” quarter estimates are based on revenue data from the QSS. The “second” and “advance” estimates for long -lived television programs, books, and other entertainment originals are based on judgmental trends. 39 Quantity estimates. The estimates of real expenditures on entertainment originals are prepared using a variety of deflators. For theatrical movies, the deflator is a weighted average of the CPI for admission to movies, theaters, and concerts , the CPI for photographic equipment and supplies, and the PPI for electronic computer manufacturing. For long -lived television programs, the deflators are composed of the CPI for admission to movies, theaters, and concerts , the CPI for photographic equipment and supplies , and the PPI for electronic computer manufacturing with differing weights for fiction and nonfiction programming. For books, the deflator is the PPI for publishing sales, excluding software —sale s of books . For music, the deflator for recorded music is the CPI for recorded music and music subscriptions, and the deflator for nonrecorded music is the CPI for admis sion to movies, theaters, and concerts . For other entertainment revenue for books, 30 percent of industry revenue for television, and 15 percent of industry revenue for miscellaneous artwork. 38 Based on research using trade sources, studies, and survey and Economic Census data from the Census Bureau, BEA estimates the following investment ratios for the five categories of entertainment originals assets: 51 percent of industry revenue for theatrical movies, 30 percent of industry revenue for television, 37 percent of industry revenue for books, 50 percent of industry revenue for music, and 15 percent of industry revenue for miscellaneous artwork. The remaining revenue is spent on nonartwork costs such as advertising, stamping DVDs, or printing books. The NIPAs record these nonartwork costs as current production costs. 39 Because of data limitations, BEA does not publish current quarterly estimates for individual entertainment -original components.

Inventory investment is one of the most volatile components of gross domestic product (GDP) , giving it an important ro le in short run variations in GDP growth . Moreover, inventory movement plays a key role in the timing, duration, and magnitude of business cycles, as unanticipated buildups in inventories may signal future cutbacks in production , and unanticipated shortages in inventories may signal future pickups in production. The CIPI estimates are the building blocks for BEA’s estimates of inventory stocks. These stock estimates, coupled with BEA’s estimates of final sales, form inventory-sales ratios that can be used to assess the likelihood that businesses will add to, or reduce, inventories in response to changes in demand. The CIPI estimates are an integral part of the U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts that provide s a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “ Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts ”).",
  "208": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-2 Definitions and Concepts CIPI is the NIPA measure of the flow (or change) in the stock of inventories held by private business over a specified period.1 The stock of inventories is the value of the goods owned by private business at the end of a specified period, whether the goods were produced or acquired in that period or in p revious periods . Inventories are maintained by business in order to facilitate the production and distribution of goods or services. The items held in inventory may be in the form of goods ready for sale (finished goods), of goods undergoing production ( work in process ), or of goods acquired for use in t he production process ( materials and supplies ) (table 7.1). For example, an auto dealer keeps a variety of makes, models, and parts on hand to meet the varied requirements and preferences of potential customers ; an auto manufacturer keeps supplies of inputs, such as steel, on hand for use in manufacturing new vehicles. Table 7 .1—Content of Change in Private Inventories Category of inventory Comments Finished/ready -for-sale goods inventory The value of produced goods held for future sale. Applies to most industries. Work -in-process inventory The value of goods still in the process of production. Applies to manufacturing and publishing industries. Materials and supplies inventory The value of natural resources and basic manufactured goods that are acquired by business for use as inputs to the production process. Applies to manufacturing, mining, construction, utilities , and publishing industries. A general principle underlying NIPA accounting is that production should be recorded at the time it occurs. In the measurement of GDP , the other product -side components, such as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and fixed investment, record final sales in the current period , but these sales may involve goods that were produced—or at least partially produced —in earlier periods. The recording of movements of goods in inventory—materials and supplies , work -in-process, and finished goods —and from inventor ies to final sales provides the means to allocate production to the period in which it occurred (see the box on the next page for a simple example of the allocation ). 1 In the NIPAs, private bus iness consists of all priva te entities that produce goods a nd services for sa le a t a price intended to a t lea st a pproximate production costs a nd of certain other private entities that are treated as business in the NIPAs. These other entities include mutual financial institutions, private noninsured pension funds, cooperatives, and nonprofit organizations that primarily serve business (that is, entities classified as nonprofit by the Internal Revenue Service in determining income ta x lia bility), Federa l Reserve banks, and federally sponsored credit agencies.",
  "209": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-3 Simple Example of CIPI Role in Calculating GDP [Billions of dolla rs] Auto Manufacturer Auto dealer GDP Materials and supplies Finished goods Goods ready for sa le Sa les I -10,000 +20,000 ….. ….. +10,000 II ….. -20,000 +20,000 ….. 0 III ….. ….. -20,000 +22,000 +2,000 • At the beginning of period I, an auto manufacturer has in inventory $10,000 of steel and other materials and supplies that it will use as inputs to produce an automobile . • In period I, the manufacturer uses the materials and supplies from inventory and its own resources (such as labor) to produce the automobile. The value of the materials and supplies used ($10,000) is subtracted from those inventories, and the value of the produced automobile ($20,000) is added to the finished goods inventory. Thus, total change in inventories is +$10,000, and this amount — which represents production, or value added, in this period—is added to GDP . • In period II, the manufacturer ships the finished auto to an auto dealer. The value of the manufacturer’s finished goods inventory decreases by $20,000, and the value of the dealer’s inventory of autos ready for sale increases by $20,000. GDP is not affecte d. • In period III, the dealer sells the auto to a consumer for $22,000. The dealer’s inventory declines by $20,000. GDP increases by $2,000 (PCE of $22,000 plus CIPI of –$20,000), which represents the value added by the dealer in the form of retail margin. As a result of this accounting for inventories, the process of assembling the materials and supplies into a finished automobile is recorded in period I, when it actually occurred, rather than in period III, when the final sale occurred. Similarly, the value added by steel manufacturers and other producers of the materials and supplies that were used as inputs in period I would have been recorded in earlier periods when those goods were produced. In measuring the level of GDP , the change in, not the level of, inventories provides the appropriate measure of the flow of economic activity that is consistent with that measured by the other GDP components . A positive CIPI indicates that total production (GDP) exceeded the sum of the final sales components of GDP in the current period and that the excess production was added to inventories. A negative CIPI indicates that final sales exceed ed production in the current period and that the excess sales were filled by drawing down inventories . CIPI is valued in the average prices for the period because units move in and out of inventories continuously over the course of the period.",
  "210": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-4 In measuring the change in GDP, the change in CIPI ( or the change in inventory investment) is the relevant measure. For example, inventories may contribute to an increase in GDP (1) by accumulating in the current period after decumulating in the preceding period, (2) by accumulating more in the current period than in the preceding period, or (3) by decumulating less in the current period than in the preceding period (table 7. 2). Table 7. 2—Effects of Change in CIPI on Change in GDP [Billions of dollars] Most of the CIPI estimates are derived from information recorded in business - accounting statements. For an illustration of the relationships between business - accounting practices and the principles of national accounting and their varying impacts on the measurement of inventories, cost of goods sold, and profits, see appendix A to this chapter. In business accounting, t he change in the book value of inventories is the measure of the difference between inventory acquisitions and inventory withdrawals during the accounting period. Generally , when a good is placed in inventory, it is valued on a firm’s books at the price prevailing whe n the good enters into inventory; this is sometimes referred to as “acquisition ” or “historical” cost. However, there are a number of different accounting methods —such as “last in, first out” (LIFO) and “first in, first out” (FIFO) — that can be used in determining the value of the goods that are withdrawn from inventories and of the goods that remain in inventories over time. 2 Another general principle underlying NIPA accounting is that (a) production should be valued at the price prevailing when it occurs , regardless of wheth er the good is sold immediately or it is entered into inventor y for sale at a later time , and (b) a good that is withdrawn from inventor y must be valued at the price prevailing when it is withdrawn, so holding gains or losses do not affect the measure of production in the current period. In business accounting , a good leaving inventory is frequently valued at historical cost— that is, at the price that prevailed when it entered inventory (see appendix A) . The 2 LIFO is a method of accounting valuation of inventories that assumes the goods acquired most recently are used up first, so that withdraw als from inventory are primarily valued at recent acquisition costs. FIFO is a method that assumes the oldest stock in inventories is used up first, so withdraw als from inventory are primarily valued at earlier acquisition costs. Other valuation methods include “average cost,” “market cost,” and “standard cost.” Inventory level [stock] CIPI [flow] Contribution of change in CIPI to change in GDP I II III II III III (1) 500 495 500 -5 5 10 (2) 500 510 530 10 20 10 (3) 500 485 480 -15 -5 10",
  "211": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-5 difference between the business -accounting measure of change in the book value of inventories and the NIPA measure of CIPI is the gain or loss from holding goods in inventory; it is termed the inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) (see the section “Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods ”). Recording in the NIPAs As described above, CIPI provides a bridge between final sales in the current period and production in the current period. It is one of the few NIPA components that can be negative. In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, CIPI appears in the Domest ic Income and Product Account (a ccount 1) as a component of gross private domestic investment and in the Domestic Capital Account (a ccount 6) as a component of gross domestic investment. In the NIPAs, the inventory estimates are generally shown by industry classification , using the North American Industry Classification System, rather than by type of product classification (see Chapter 2). Thus, for example, “wholesale trade durable goods inventories” signifies “inventories held by industries engaged in the wholesale trade of durable goods .” CIPI by industry is presented in NIPA table group 5.7. Stocks of private inventories , along with the corresponding aggregate estimates of final sales and inventory-sales ratios, are shown in table group 5.8. The following is a list of the principal NIPA tables that present the inventory estimates: 5.7.5B Change in Private Inventories by Industry 5.7.6B Change in Real Private Inventories by Industry, Chained Dollars 5.8.5B Private Inventories and Domestic Final Sales by Industry 5.8.6B Real Private Inventories and Real Domestic Final Sales by Industry, Chained Dollars 5.8.9B Implicit Price Deflators for Private Inventories by Industry In addition, estimates of change in motor vehicle inventories are shown in tables 7.2.5B and 7.2.6B, and estimates of change in farm inventories are shown in tables 7.3.5 and 7.3.6. BEA also prepares estimates of the change in private inventories that are not seasonally adjusted; these are available in Section 8 of the NIPA Interactive Data Tables. The tables present nominal, or “current -dollar” measures and “real,” or inflation -adju sted measures . Additionally, BEA prepares “Underlying Detail” tables for the estimates shown in NIPA table group 5. 7, including detail for change in the book values and for IVA by industry, at a greater level of detail than is shown in the published estimates.",
  "212": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-6 BEA publishes estimates of real inventories, sales, and inventory-sales ratios for the manufacturing and trade industries each quarter in the S urvey of Current Business (generally in the January, April, July, and October issues). BEA also prepares “Underlying Detail” tables for these estimates . Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier in this handbook, the NIPA estimates, including those for CIPI, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data ”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see Chapter 4 : Estimating Methods ). For farm inventories, the estimates of crop and of livestock inventory change are prepared as the product of the change in the physical volume and of the a verage price , based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) . For example, changes in stocks of wheat on the farm are calculated as wheat harvested and available for sale less wheat sold , valued at average market prices. The estimates of farm inventories include materials and supplies —such as feed, fertilizer, and purchased seed —that are used as inputs to farm production. For crops, the estimates also take into account Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans to producers who use agricultural commodities as collateral. 3 Because the estimates of farm inventories are prepared using data on quantities and current prices rather than business -accounting data , an IVA is not calculated . For nonfarm industries, the estimates of inventory change are generally prepared by beginning with data on the end-of -period book value of inventories , as reported by private business using a variety of accounting methods. 4 The inventory data are then adjusted —annually for 167 industries and monthly for 133 industries —to value the inventories at a uniform set of prices and to remove holding gains or losses . More specifically, f or manufacturing and trade industries , data on the book value of inventory stocks , inventory turnover, and on the methods of inventory valuation are collected in economic censuses and annual surveys conducted by the Census Bureau . Businesses that use LIFO accounting also provide the Census Bureau with an estimate of the “LIFO reserve,” an adjustment for converting their inventories to a non-LIFO valuation. Data on inventory stock s at the end of the month (and quarter) are collected in 3 Placement of crops as collateral for CCC loans is treated as an addition to farm inventories. Redemption of the crop after loan repayment or forfeiture of the crop after loan default are each treated as a withdrawal from farm inventories. The data on the physical quantities of crops placed, redeemed, and forfeited are from USDA and are valued using average market prices. 4 As a practical matter, the source data for end -of period inventories reflect losses that result from damage, theft, and other causes, as well as business write -downs. When these episodic events can be identified, BEA adjusts the source data to remove thes e affects.",
  "213": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-7 the Census Burea u’s monthly surveys . In the Census Bureau’s published reports of manufacturing and trade inventories , all inventories are valued on a “non-LIFO basis .”5 For most other nonfarm industries , annual data on the book value of inventory stock s are available from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tabulations of business tax returns. The data include information on inventory stocks, the proportions of those stocks that are valued on a LIFO basis , and inventory turnover. For most nonfarm industries, the principal price data used in estimating NIPA inventories are producer price i ndexes (PPIs) and import price indexes , both from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS). For the manufacturing and publishing industries, the prices for work -in-process and finished goods inventories consist of a combination of the following: the cost of materials and supplies, based on PPIs; labor costs, based on BEA - constructed unit labor cost indexes ; and overhead costs —including rent, depreciation charges, and repair costs —primarily based on PPIs . The BEA labor cost indexes cover compensation of production workers, supervisors, and nonproduction personnel working at the plant and are based on BEA wage data. At the most detailed level for which BEA prepares estimates, the procedure for nonfarm inventor ies generally consists of the following steps that yield current -dollar and constant -dollar estimates for CIPI and for the stocks of goods held in inventory. For an illustration of the estimation procedure, see appendix B to this chapter. 1. Separating Census Bureau published inventories (which are on a non- LIFO basis) into those that were reported on a LIFO basis and those that were reported using other accounting methods. 2. Construction of current -period inventory price indexes for each industry, and for manufacturing and for publishing , each stage of fabrication. 3. Construction of monthly cost indexes for each industry, and for manufacturing and publishing, each stage of fabrication . 4. Revaluation of the book-value inventories to yield constant -dollar and current -dollar change in inventories. 5. Calculation of the IVA. 6. Calculation of c urrent -dollar and constant -dollar stocks . As noted earlier, the IVA is the measure of the holding gains or loss es that are removed from the business -accounting measure of inventory change . It is calculated for all inventory -accounting methods, regardless of whether inventories a re accumulating or decumulating over the recording period . However, under LIFO accounting, if inventor ies are accumulating , withdrawals are already valued at current -period prices; thus, CIPI and change in the book value are equal , and the IVA is zero (see appendix A). 5 The Census Bureau reports inventories on a non -LIFO basis because during periods of rising inventories and prices, LIFO accounting may result in stock estimates that are considerably undervalued (see appendix A).",
  "214": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-8 In the NIPAs, the IVA is also used on the income side of the accounts in order to exclude the inventory holding gains (or losses) from business income in the calculation of corporate profits and of nonfarm proprietors’ income.6 Since profit and income data come from IRS tabulations , the product -side IVA must be adjusted for any accounting - basis differences between the IRS data and the Census Bureau data. (The estimates for nonfarm industries other than manufacturing and trade are already based on IRS data, so in most cases no adjustment is needed for those industries.) In estimating the stocks of private inventories, the constant -dollar estimates are derived first, using the perpetual inventory method—that is, by adding the change in real private inventories during the period to the real stocks at the end of the preceding period (see “perpetual inventory method” in Chapter 4). The end -of-period current -dollar estimates of the stock of private inventories are then derived by “reflati on”—that is, by multiplying estimates of the end-of-period real -stock s by appropriate price indexes. Table 7.A at the end of this chapter summarizes the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the benchmark-year , nonbenchmark -year , current quarterly, and quantity (inflation-adjusted) estimates for the CIPI categories that are shown by industry in NIPA table group 5.7. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Benchmark -year estimates For manufacturing , data on the book value of inventory stocks and on the methods of inventory valuation are available from the Census Bureau’s E conomic Census. Manufacturing establishments report their end-of -year inventory levels and their inventories by stage of fabrication (finished, work-in -process, and materials and supplies). Information on the distribution of costs in the manufacturing sector among materi als, labor, and overhead is used in the calculation of cost of goods sold and of inventory turnover ratios (see appendix B). The commodity composition of materials held in inventory is assumed to be the same as that for materials purchased by the industry, which, in turn, is derived from BEA’s benchmark input -output accounts, based on information from the economic censuses on materials “consumed” by industry. This information is used in the calculation of materials held in inventory. For wholesale and retail trade, data on the book value of inventory stocks and the methods of inventory valuation are available from the E conomic Census. Retail and wholesale trade establishments report their inventories of goods for sale at the end of the 6 See NIPA table 6.14D , “Inventory Valuation Adjustment to Nonfarm Incomes by Legal Form of Organization and by Industry,” available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov .",
  "215": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-9 year.7 LIFO users also report the LIFO reserve and the LIFO value after adjustment for the reserve. For wholesale and retail trade, data on purchases from the Economic Census are used in the calculation of cost of goods sold and of inventory-turnover ratios. In addition, data on product -line sales by industry are used in the calculation of commodities held in inventory. For the mining and construction industries, the inventory estimates for benchmark years are based on information from the Economic Census. For the publishing industry, the inventory estimates are based on information from the S ervice Annual Survey. For all other nonfarm industries, the estimates for all years except the most recent year are based on IRS tabulations of income tax returns for corporations and for sole proprietorships and partnerships. For farm inventories, the estimates for all years ( benchmark and nonbenchmark) are based on USDA annual reports. Annual changes in farm inventories of crops are estimated as crops harvested in the period and available for sale (that is, not including crops retained for personal consumption) less crops sold in the period plus net CCC loan transactions . The annual quantity changes for each crop are valued at average market prices received by farmers during the calendar year. Annual changes in farm inventories of livestock are estimated from USDA surve ys of inventory stocks on farms. For each livestock commodity, annual quantity changes are valued at average market price per head. Nonbenchmark-year estimates For years other than benchmark years and the most recent year , the inventory estimates for the manufacturing , trade , and publishing industries are primarily based on the Census Bureau ’s Annual Survey of M anufactures, Annual Wholesale Trade Survey, Annual Retail Trade Survey, and S ervice Annual Survey. Respondents to these surveys report LIFO , LIFO reserve, and non-LIFO valuations separately. In addition, respondents in the manufacturing sector report information on the distribution of costs among materials, labor, and overhead and those in ret ail and wholesale report purchases; this information is used in the calculation of cost of goods sold and of inventory-turnover ratios. For the mining , utilities, and construction industries, as well as for other nonfarm industries, the estimates for all nonbenchmark years except the most recent year are based on IRS tabulations of income tax returns for corporations and for sole proprietorships and partnerships. 7 The wholesale trade inventory data published by the Census Bureau include inventories that are owned by U.S. establishments but are held abroad. BEA adjusts these wholesale trade data in order to exclude those inventories. The retail trade inventory data published by the Census Bureau exclude inventories that are owned by U.S. establishments but are held abroad.",
  "216": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-10 The sources and methods for deriving the nonbenchmark-year estimates of farm inventories are the same as those for the benchmark estimates (see above). Most -recent -year and c urrent -quarterly estimates The seasonally adjusted inventory estimates for the most recent year and for the current quarters for the manufacturing and trade in dustries (except those for retail auto dealers ) are based on the fo llowing Census Bureau surveys: M onthly Survey of Manufacturers’ Shipments, Inventories, and O rders; Monthly Wholesale Trade Survey; Monthly Retail Trade Survey; and the Census Bureau’s monthly Advance Economic Indicators Report .8 The data for manufacturing, wholesale trade, and retail trade are summarized in the Census Bureau’s monthly “Business Sales and Inventories” release. The quarterly estimates for the manufacturing and trade industries are calculated as end - of-month inventories for the final month of the quarter less end -of-month inventories for the final month of the preceding quarter. For retail auto dealers, seasonally adjusted inventory estimates for the most recent year and for the current quarters are primarily based on a weighted average of BEA’s unit-based estimates, which are based on the monthly unit data from Wards’ Intelligence , and of Census Bureau total motor vehicle inventories . For utilities, the seasonally adjusted quantity estimates are prepared first, using data on changes in the physical stocks of coal, petroleum, and natural gas and on base - year prices from the Energy Information Administration. Th e current -dollar estimates are then derived by “reflation” —that is, by multiplying the quantity estimates by appropriate price data from BLS. For all other nonfarm industries, seasonally adjusted estimates for the most recent year and for the current quarters are prepared by starting with the previous annual level and by assum ing that inventories move proportionately with certain other indicator series chosen for each industry or by judgmental trend. The indicator series include inventory inform ation from the Census Bureau’s Q uarterly Financial Report and monthly measures of act ivity from the Census Bureau’s construction s tatistics and from BLS industry wage data. For seasonally adjusted farm inventories, quarterly estimates of crop inventor ies, which are calculated only for total crops , are based on a BEA quarterly allocation of USDA annual projections of crop output and cash receipts. Quarterly estimates of livestock inventories are based on USDA data by type of livestock. 8 The Census Bureau’s Advance Economic Indicators Report provides advance statistics for U.S. International Trade in Goods, domestic retail inventories, and domestic wholesale inventories. Advance measures of domestic retail and wholesale inventories were first provided in July 2016; the Census Bureau provides the report to BEA in time for it to be incorporated into its advance estimates of GDP.",
  "217": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-11 The not seasonally adjusted ( NSA ) estimates of inventories are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates, using the not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators. Quantity and price estimate s The quantity estimates f or the detailed inventory components are primarily derived by deflation, as shown in appendix B. (For a general description of the deflation method, see “Estimates for detail ed components” in Chapter 4.) In the NIPAs, the aggregate measures for most of the components of real GDP are calculated from the detailed components as chain -type quantity and price indexes (see “Estimates for NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 4). However, the detailed CIPI estimates may co ntain negative values (which could require the Fisher formula to take the square root of a negative number). 9 Therefore , the end-of period, chain -weighted estimates of inventory stocks are calculated first, and the CIPI chained -dollar estimates are then calculated as the differences between these estimates . Under this procedure, inventory stocks are used as weights for inventory flows, though the composition of the stocks may differ from the composition of the inventory investment flows. 9 The inability to calculate Fisher quantity indexes for CIPI does not extend to higher level aggregates ( such as gross private domestic investment and GDP) that include CIPI as a component, because the negative values of CIPI are small relative to the leve ls of the other components of those aggregates.",

The illustration is based on one retail establishment that holds only one type of good in inventory. The unit cost and the sales price increase over time, but they are equal to each other in each period , so any profit (or loss) made by the establishment is solely the result of changes in the prices of goods held in inventory. Exhibit 1 provides information on goods purchased by the establishment in periods 0 to 3; these goods then we re sold in that same period or were added to inventory . It also provides information on goods sold by the establishment in periods 1 to 3; these goods were purchased in that same period or were withdrawn from the inventory of goods that were purchased in earlier periods .

The turnover period (the average time a good is held in inventory), which is used in deriving the monthly cost index, is 4 months . The turnover pattern (the pattern of how goods are withdrawn from inventory), is also used in deriving the monthly cost index. The pattern, star ting with the most recent month, is 0.23, 0.62, 0.14, and 0.01. • The inventory composition for this industry is 40 percent of commodity A and 60 percent of commodity B.

Exports measures the portion of total U.S. production of goods and services —gross domestic product (GDP) —that is provided to the rest of the world; thus, movements in exports reflect changes in foreign demand for U.S. -produced goods and services. Imports measures the portion of total U.S. expenditures —gross domestic purchases —that is accounted for by goods and ser vices provided by the rest of the world; thus, movements in imports reflect changes in domestic demand for foreign-produced goods and services. The impact of imports on the U.S. economy depends on the degree to which they act as substitutes for, or as complements to, domestic production. Together, the two measures reflect the extent to which the United States participates in the global marketplace, which provides broad opportunities for specialization and other economic efficiencies. As the difference between the two, net exports represents the gap between U.S. domestic production and U.S. domestic demand and the extent to which a surplus or deficit of domestic production relative to domestic demand is addressed by foreign markets. Net exports in the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) corresponds to the measure “balance on goods and services”—commonly referred to as the “trade deficit” (when imports exceeds exports) or the “trade surplus” (when exports exceeds imports) —in the international transactions (or balance of payments) accounts (ITAs), also produced by BEA. 1 The two measures are very similar , but they differ in coverage, definitions , and in timing of revisions (see the section “Adjustments and other differences between the NIPA and ITA estimates). Net exports is also a component of the “ balance on current account,” a measure in both the ITAs and the NIPAs that also includes receipts and payments of income and receipts and payments of current taxes, contributions for government social insurance, and transfers. 1 For a detailed description of the ITAs, see “ U.S. International Economic Accounts: Concepts and Methods ” available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov .",
  "232": "CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 8-2 Net exports also relates GDP to other important aggregates in the NIPAs. GDP less net exports is equal to gross domestic purchases, which is the market value of goods and services purchased by U.S. residents regardless of where those goods and services are produced. Final sales of domestic product (worldwide final sales of U.S. production) less net exports is equal to final sales to domestic purchasers, which is the market value of final goods and services purchased by U.S. residents regardless of where those goods and services are produced. Net exports is also used in preparing two alternative measures of U.S. production—command-basis GDP and command -basis gross national product (GNP) — that provide information on the real purchasing power of the income generated by U.S. production of goods and services.2 These measures reflect the impact of changes in the terms of trade and of changes in production on the purchasing power associated with the nation’s output. More specifically, these measures deflate exports and imports of goods and services (and, in the c ase of command -basis GNP, also income receipts and payments) by the price index for gross domestic purchases (which measures the prices of goods and services purchased by U.S. residents). Thus, the command-basis measures reflect the prices of purchased goods and services, while real GDP and real GNP reflect the prices of produced goods and services. Other related measures include the trading gains index , which is measured as the ratio of the GDP price index to the price index for gross domestic purchases, a nd the terms of trade index , which is measured as the ratio of the price index for exports of goods and services to the price index for imports of goods and services. 3 Definitions and Concepts The estimates of net exports are an integral part of the NIPAs, a set of accounts that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts ”). As discussed in Chapter 2, net exports is one of the final expenditure s components of GDP. It is equal to exports , which measures all goods and services sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by residents of the United States to foreign residents (also referred to as nonresidents or the rest of the world) less imports, an offsetting component of GDP that measures all goods and services sold , given away, or otherwise transferred by foreign residents to U.S. residents. The inclusion of exports as a component of GDP is straightforward; as explained in Chapter 2, in the final expenditures approach, GDP is measured by summing the final expenditures of persons, businesses, governments, and foreigners for goods and services produced in the United States. Because exports to foreign residents represent the endpoint 2 GDP measures the value of goods and services produced by labor and property loc ated in the United States , while GNP measures the value of goods and services produced by labor and property supplied by U.S. residents . GNP is equal to GDP less net income payments to the rest of the world. BEA also prepares alternative command -basis measures of net national product and of net domestic product. 3 For more information , see the section “ Principal quantity and price measures ” in C hapter 2 .",
  "233": "CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 8-3 of domestic production, they include goods and services intended for intermediate as well as final use; any further processing that occurs outside of the United States is foreign production and is not included in GDP. For example, automotive parts that are produced in the United States and shipped to a final assembly plant in Canada are included in U.S. exports and counted as final expenditures in GDP. The inclusion of imports as an offsetting entry in deriving GDP and the inclusion of intermediate goods and services in imports warrant further explanation. Imports represent production that has occurred outside the United States, and thus they are not included in GDP. However, purchases of imported goods and services, as well as purchases of domestic goods and services, are included in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), gross private domestic investment, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment so that these final expenditure components of GDP will accurately reflect the aggregate demand of persons, businesses, and governments for goods and services wherever they are produced. 4 Thus, imports is included in the calculation of GDP as a counter -entry that offsets the non-U.S. production that is included in these final expenditure s components. For example, a U.S. consumer may purchase an automobile (a final good) that is produced in the United States or in a foreign country. In either case, the purchase is recorded in PCE (a positive entry in deriving GDP); however, in the case of a foreign automobile, the purchase is offset in U.S. imports (a negative entry in deriving GDP).5 Similarly, a domestic automobile manufacturer may purchase steel (an intermediate good) from either a domestic or a foreign manufacturer; the steel is either used in the production process and included in the value of the final product (and therefore GDP) during that period, or it is added to the manufacturer’s inventory of materials and supplies (also a positive entry in deriving GDP). 6 The domestically produced steel reflects value added that contributes to GDP; in contrast, the foreign -produced steel reflects value added that does not reflect U.S. production and that is offset by the recording of imports of steel (a negative entry in deriving GDP). Residents of the United States —as defined in both the NIPAs and the ITAs —are (1) individuals residing permanently in the United States, (2) business enterprises and nonprofit organizations established under U.S. laws, including corporations, partnerships, and proprietorships , and (3) U.S. federal, state, and local governments, together with their 4 Additionally, the source data for estimating these final expenditures components do not, for the most part, distinguish between domestically produced and foreign -produced goods and services. 5 Another example is the payments by U.S. residents to foreign residents for travel services. These expenditures are included in PCE collectively as “Foreign travel by U.S. residents” in the category “Net foreign travel”; unlike other expenditures on imports, they are not distributed among the individual PCE categories. They are al so recorded as imports of goods and services; thus, the PCE and import entries cancel out in deriving GDP. For the results of research aimed at better separ ating spending by nonresidents from spending by U.S. residents in the detailed PCE statistics, see Michael Armah and Teresita Teensma, “Research Spotlight: Estimates of Categories of Personal Consumption Expenditures Adjusted for Net Foreign Travel Spending ,” Survey of Current Business 92 (April 2012): 13 –21. 6 The NIPA accounting for change in private inventories ensures that the value added at each stage of domestic production —including production of intermediate goods —is included in GDP in the period in which it occurs without being double -counted as further processing occurs (see the box “Simple Example of CIPI Role in Ca lcula ting GDP” “ Chapter 7: Change in Private Inventories ”).",

The definition of residency impacts the NIPAs and the ITAs differently because the geographic boundary of the United States differs between the two sets of accounts. In the NIPAs, the domestic economy of the United States encompasses the 50 states, the 7 The measure of net exports presented in the NIPAs is referred to in the ITAs as the “cross -border” measure of international transactions. The cross -border measure is an important indicator of U.S. performance in foreign markets ; it reflects the net value of the transactions in goods and services between U.S. residents (including companies) and foreign residents. In addition, BEA annually provides a supplemental, “ownership -based” framework of the current - a ccount portion of the ITAs in which net receipts resulting from sa les by a ffilia tes of U.S. and of foreign companies are combined with the “ cross -border ” m easures of exports and imports to provide an indicator of the net effect of United States -foreign commerce on the U.S. economy. This alternative framework, which is usually published in the January issue of the Survey of Current Business , recognizes that both cross -border trade and sales through affiliates represent methods of active participation in the international markets for goods and services.",

In the ITAs, U.S. commonwealths and territories are included as part of the domestic economy; the flows of goods and services between them and the United States are excluded from exports and imports, but the flows of goods and services between them and the rest of the world are included in exports and imports. 8 Table 8.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, exports and imports in the NIPAs.

Instead, these expenditures are included in private fixed investment because ownership of a structure in a country signifies a center of economic interest in that country.9 Likewise, imports excludes capital expenditures by U.S. residents on structures in the rest of the world.10 As the NIPAs do not record transactions in financial assets, exports and imports do not include sales to, or purchases from, the rest of the world of financial assets (though the fees associated with these transactions are recorded as services provided) .11 The 9 A nonresident owner of a dwelling without an economic interest in that country is treated as if he or she has transferred ownership to a hypothetical resident of the country (see the section “Center of Economic Interest” in the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), (Washington, D.C.: International Monetary Fund, 2009), available at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2007/bopman6.htm ). 10 The returns to U.S. residents on their investments outside the United States , including investments in structures, less the returns to foreign residents on their investments in the United States, are included in GNP but not in GDP. 11 However, financial transactions are recorded in BEA’s international accounts and in the Federal Reserve Board’s financial accounts (formerly called the flow of funds accounts).",
  "237": "CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 8-7 NIPAs also do not include illegal goods and services, which are excluded because there are insufficient source data available on illegal activities .12 The principal categories of exports and of imports are goods and services. In the NIPAs, goods are classified by type of product into broad categories that reflect the more detailed “end -use” classification system used by the ITAs . The end -use classification system for goods, which consists of 139 export categories and 142 import categories , is based on the principal use rather than the physical characteristics of the merchandise and allows changes in trade to be compared with changes in production, consumption, and income. 13 Services exports and imports in the NIPAs are generally classified by type of service. However, because of data limitations, certain services are instead classified according to the type of transactors associated with them. Examples include the detailed components of travel services and services that are exported and imported by U.S. military agencies ; the latter are classified as exports and imports of “government goods and services, n.e.c.” 14 Exports and imports of services in the NIPAs are each grouped into six broad categories that generally correspond to the aggregate categories used in the ITAs : transport, travel (for all purposes including education), charges for the use of intellectual property n.e.c., other business services, government goods and services n.e.c., and other exports or imports.15 Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of account s belonging to individual transactors in the economy. In this context, net exports represents the difference between the aggregate demand by all foreign residents for goods and services produced in the United States and the aggregate demand by all U.S. residents for goods and services produced outside the United States. 12 For more infor mation on the activities that are included in, and excluded from, production and on the exclusion of financial assets in the NIPAs, see the sections “Production boundary” and “Asset boundary” i n Chapter 2. 13 The end -use categories used by BEA —such as foods, feeds, and beverages; capital goods; industrial supplies and materials; automotive products; and consumer goods —incorporate the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Brusse ls: Customs Cooperation Council): 1984 . The system was developed under the auspices of the International Customs Cooperation Council to establish an accepted standard for the classification of internationally traded goods . 14 As part of the 2014 annual update of the NIPAs, a new category, “government goods and services n.e.c.” was introduced for both exports and imports. For exports, this component primarily consists of the previously presented category “transfers under U.S. m ilitary agency sales contracts.” For imports, the component primarily consists of the previously presented category “direct defense expenditures.” 15 The category “Other business services” consists of the following categories that are recorded separately in the ITAs: maintenance and repair services n.i.e .; insurance services ; fina ncia l services ; telecommunication, computer, and information services ; personal, cultural, and recreational services; construction services; and “other ” other business services.",

The tables present nominal, or “current -dollar” measures, “real,” or inflation -adjusted measures, and price i ndexes. The NIPAs present information on other international transactions, such as income receipts and payments, movements of capital, and taxes and transfer payments. These transactions are recorded in the Foreign Transactions Current Account (account 5) and in the Foreign Transactions Capital Account (account 7), as well as in NIPA table 4.1. The ITAs present information on exports and imports in greater detail than in the NIPAs.

  "239": "CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 8-9 Overview of Source Data and Estimating M ethods As described earlier in the handbook, most of the NIPA estimates are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods ”). Tables 8.A (exports of goods and services) and 8.B (imports of goods and services) at the end of this chapter summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current -dollar benchmark estimates, nonbenchmark annual estimate s, and current quarterly estimates, as well as the quantity and price indexes, for the categories of exports and imports shown in NIPA table group 4.2. The NIPA estimates of exports and imports are primarily based on the ITA estimates of exports and imports, though they also incorporate certain adjustments and other differences that reflect different revision schedules, geographic boundaries, and treatmen ts for certain transactions (see the section “Adjustments and other differences between the NIPA and ITA estimates” below). In turn, the ITA estimates for goods are based primarily on Census Bureau data on trade in goods, and the ITA estimates for services are based primarily on data collected on BEA surveys and on data reported by other U.S. government agencies. 17 Specifically, the ITA estimates of exports and imports of goods are based primarily on monthly compilations by the Census Bureau of data that are collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These data reflect the movement of goods between foreign countries and the United States. They exclude the following: shipments between the United States and its commonwealths and territories; shipments between the United States and its military, diplomatic, and c onsular installations abroad; shipments of U.S. goods returned to the United States by its Armed Forces; shipments of the personal and household effects of travelers; and shipments of goods that are in transit. T he data on goods are valued at the transactions price at the port of exportation, which includes inland freight, insurance, and other charges incurred in placing the goods alongside the carrier. Loading costs and freight charges for transportation of goods beyond the port of exportation are assumed to be paid by the importing country; in the ITAs, these charges are included as exports or imports in “other” transportation services. The ITA estimates of exports and imports of services are based primarily on 10 mandatory BEA “benchmark” and quarterly surveys of international services transactions. 18 These surveys provide information on the receipts and payments for a variety of services and for various types of intangible assets (such as intellectual property). The ITAs also use data from surveys conducted by other U.S. government 17 For an overview of the source data and estimating methods used in preparing the ITAs, see “U.S. International Economic Accounts: Concepts and Methods” on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov . 18 In this context, “benchmark” refers to the comprehensive nature of the survey and not to the NIPA comprehensive, or “benchmark,” revisions.",

These data are used in deriving estimates of travel, transport , and government goods and services n.e.c . Finally, a variety of published and unpublished source data—including information from U.S. g overnment budgetary documents, international organizations , trade associations, and various other international transact ors—are used in deriving certain ITA estimates of services. Tables 8.A (Exports of Goods and Services) and 8.B (Imports of Goods and Services) following the main text summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current -dollar benchmark, nonbenchmark, and current quarterly estimates and the quantity and price estimates for the categories shown in NIPA table group 4.2. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Benchmark -year and nonbenchmark-year estimates The benchmark and nonbenchmark annual NIPA estimates are derived using essentially the same methodologies. The differences between the benchmark and nonbenchmark annual NIPA estimates relate to the vintage of ITA data used and the number of years for which revisions are incorporated. Each annual NIPA revision incorporates on a best -level basis the revised statistics from the most recent annual revision of the ITAs (which occurs in June) as well as revised estimates for the first quarter of the current year from the ITA release for the second quarter (which occurs in September) .19 The time spans of the ITA annual updates revisions are not usually limited. However, the annual updates of the NIPA s are usually limited to the previous 5 years, although the adoption of flexible annual update s in 2010 allows the expansion to additional years if warranted.20 Therefore, unless the revision period is expanded, the NIPA estimates for earlier years will differ from the ITA estimates by the amount of the revisions incorporated into the ITAs but not incorporated into the NIPAs (as well as by the other revisions incorporated into the NIPAs but not into the ITAs ). As a result, the NIPA time series of foreign transactions may reflect a discontinuity between the years covered by the NIPA annual update and the preceding years. The discontinuities within the NIPA series and the statistical differences between the NIPAs and the ITAs are generally resolved during be nchmark revisions of the NIPAs (which generally occur every 5 years and which incorporate revisions as far back as necessary).21 However, the adjustments and other differences described below will 19 See “Best level and best change” in Chapter 4. 20 The revision period for BEA’s estimates was expanded from 3 to 5 years as part of the 2018 comprehensive update of the NIPAs.

NIPA table group 4.3 provides a complete reconciliation of the differences between the NIPAs and the ITAs . Current quarterly estimates Monthly statistics on trade in goods, based on Census Bureau compilations of the customs data, and on trade in services, primarily based on BEA surveys and on data reported by other U.S. government agencies, are provided in a Census Bureau -BEA news release. 22 For seasonally adjusted exports and imports of goods, the “advance” quarterly NIPA estimates are based on Census Bureau trade data for the first 2 months of the quarter and the Census advanced trade report for the 3rd month of the quarter. “Second” quarterly NIPA estimates are based on the Census Bureau data for all three months of the quarter. The “third” quarterly NIPA estimates are based on the quarterly ITAs, which incorporate revised Census Bureau data. 23 For seasonally adjusted exports and imports of services, the “advance” and “second” quarterly NIPA estimates are largely based on various ITA indicator series that are used to extrapolate from the latest source data. The “third” quarterly NIPA estimates are based on the quarterly ITA estimates, which incorporate data from BEA transportation surveys, extrapolations of BEA survey data on royalties and license fees and “other” private services, and data reported by other U.S. government agencies (and which are used to revise the monthly trade data). The ITA quarterly estimates are incorporated into the NIPA estimates on a “best -change” basis. 24 After the third current quarterly estimate, the NIPA estimates of net exports are not revised again until the next annual update . The not seasonally adjusted ( NSA ) estimates of exports and imports are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted estimates , using not seasonally adjusted source data . In addition, the adjustments and other differences that reflect the different release schedules, geographic boundaries, and treatments for certain transactions of the seasonally adjusted NIPA estimates of exports and imports and the seasonally adjusted ITA estimates are also incorporated in the not seasonally adjusted estimates (see comprehensive update .

Gold is used for two purposes: for industrial demand (as an input into the production of goods and services, such as jewelry, watches, and electronic equipment) and for investment (as a store of wealth and a hedge against inflation). In the NIPAs, all do mestic production of gold, regardless of its final use, is included in GDP. However, the NIPAs do not treat transactions in valuables, such as gold, as investments in fixed assets, and so investments in gold (other than gold held in 26 For years prior to 1999, the ITAs do not separ ately record these implicit measures ; a n imputation is made in the NIPAs for their value for 1986 -1998.

In contrast, in the international guidelines presented in the System of Accounts 2008 ( SNA ), the capital account includes the net acquisition of gold and similar valuables (such as antiques and other art objects) that are held as stores of value in gross fixed capital formation as “Acquisitions less disposals of valuables.” Only a small share of the international transactions in nonmonetary gold recorded in the ITAs is for business or industrial use; most transactions are for investment or other purposes. Consequently, the NIPA estimates for exports and imports of nonmonetary gold are not based on the ITA estimates. Instead, the NIPAs incorporate a special adjustment for transactions in gold. The NIPA estimates for gold begin with an estimate of domestic production of gold, which is included in GDP and in the associated gross domestic income for gold. Domestic gold production is measured as the sum of mine production of gold and of secondary pr oduction of gold in the United States multiplied by the average price of gold. 28 Annual and quarterly estimates of gold production are based on data provided by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Mineral Industry Surveys —Precious Metals . The average price of gold is based on the producer price index for metal ore mining from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Part of domestic gold production is for domestic industrial use (that is, business transactions in gold used for production of final goods, such as jewelry, specialty coins, and medals and for electronics and dental applications). Annual and quarterly esti mates of industrial demand for gold are derived using World Gold Council (WGC) data on gold used for production multiplied by the average price of gold. The difference between domestic gold production and industrial demand for gold is entered into the NIPAs in the form of an adjustment to net exports: specifically, the adjustment consists of removing the ITA estimates of exports (line 2) and imports (line 20) of nonmonetary gold and of adding “Gold, NIPAs” (line 22) to imports with its sign reversed. 29 This treatment maintains the relationship of GDP to gross domestic purchases (gross domestic purchases is equal to GDP minus net exports) while protecting the integrity of the other final expenditures components of GDP.30 27 Because source data do no t allow a complete accounting of valuables for the United States , investments in valuables are not included in the NIPAs. S ee “Asset boundary” in C hapter 2 . 28 Secondary production of gold is the supply of gold available from scrap (used gold). 29 Thus, if domestic gold production exceeds industrial demand for gold (as it has since 1987), the excess supply of gold is available for export or for use as a store of valuables by domestic investors. If industrial demand exceeds domestic production, the gap in the supply of gold would need to be filled by imports or through the sale of gold by domestic investors. 30 This trea tment is not strictly a ppropriate for analyses of international competitiveness, but its effects will not be significant as long as the net values remain small and stable.",

The lines in table 8.2 for “statistical differences” reconcile the different revision cycles of the NIPAs and the ITAs discussed earlier. Adjustment for U.S. territories (lines 4, 9, 2 3, and 27). As discussed earlier, the “U.S. estimates” for the NIPAs cover the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. military installations, embassies, and consulates abroad , while the “U.S. estimates” for the ITAs include the se geographical areas as well as commonwealths and territories of the United States. Therefore, an adjustment must be made to the ITA statistics to make the geographic coverage consistent with the NIPA coverage. In practice, t he adj ustment is made only for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; the value of trade with other U.S. territories and commonwealths is relatively small. The adjustment consists of adding the value of U .S. trade with Puerto Rico and with the U.S. Virgin Islands to the ITA estimates and of deducting the value of their trade with the rest of the world from the ITA estimates. For U.S. exports and imports of goods to and from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and for exports and imports between them and the rest of the world, the annual and quarterly estimates for the adjustments are based on Census Bureau data on trade in goods . For exports and imports of services, the annual estimates of the value of U.S. exports to, and imports from, Puerto Rico are based on BEA’s Puerto Rico GDP statistics, and the q uarterly estimates are based on judgmental trend. There is no territorial adjustment in the NIPAs for U.S. services exported to, or imported from, the U.S. Virgin Islands; however, the data for exports and imports of goods suggest that the value for services is very small. There is also no adjustment for the value of trade in services between either Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands and the rest of the world; total trade data suggest that these values are also very small . Adjustment for other items (line 8). In the ITAs, certain military grant transfers were treated as exports of services. In the NIPAs, some transfers of services under military grant programs, such as peace and humanitarian operations, are included in federal government transfer payments . Thus, an adjustment is made to remove these transfers from the ITA data on exports of services. Quantity and price estimates In general, t he estimates of quantities purchased, or real spending, for the most detailed components of most exports and imports are prepared by deflation. In the deflation method, the quantities are calculated by dividing the current -dollar value of the component by an appropriate price index. For most categories of exports and imports of goods, the price indexes are BLS export and import price indexes. However, for several categories of capital goods that",
  "246": "CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 8-16 have known quality-adjustment challenges , alternative quality -adjusted indexes are substituted . Quality -adjusted prices from the Federal Reserve Board are used in deflating selected components of exports and imports of telecommunications equipment. A BLS producer price index is used to deflate exports of semiconductors .31 A BLS consumer price index for smart phones is used to deflate components of imports of other durable household goods.32 BEA quality -adjusted price indexes are used to deflate imports of photocopier equipment33 and export s and imports of scientific, hospital, and medical equipment. Finally , several types of exports and imports of transportation equipment are deflated using specific PPIs, because export and import price indexes are not available at that level of detail.34 For most categories of services, BLS export or import prices are not available. Instead, PPIs, consumer price indexes , or BEA composite indexes of prices or of input costs are used for deflation.35 In addition, the quantity estimates for several categories of exports and imports are prepared using methods other than deflation. For example, the quantity estimates for petroleum and petroleum products imports are prepared using direct valuation—that is, by multiplying the base -year price by the current -period quantity data . (For general descriptions of the above methods, see “Estimates for detailed components” in Chapter 4.) The aggregate measures of exports and imports are calculated from the detailed components as chain-type quantity and price indexes (for information about these calculations, see “Estimates for NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 4). BEA also prepares measures of real exports and imports and their components in a dollar -denominated form, designated “chained -dollar” estimates (see “Chained -dollar measures” in Chapter 4). Net exports in chained dollars is calculated as the difference between chained -dollar exports and chained -dollar imports —that is, real net exports is derived as the difference between real exports and real imports.36 31 See Robert P. Parker and Eugene P. Seskin, “ Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts ,” Survey 77 (August 1997): 30. 32 “Other durable household goods” includes smartphones; for more information on the indexes used to deflate purchases of cellular telephones, see Jason W.

Government consumption expenditures consists of spending by government to produce and provide services to the public, such as national defense and public school education. Gross investment consists of spending by government for fixed assets that directly benefit the public, such as highway construction, or that assist government agencies i n their production activities , such as purchases of military hardware. Government activity —at the federal, state, and local levels —affects the economy in many ways. As noted above, governments contribute to economic output when they provide services to the public and when they invest in capital. They also provide social benefits, such as social security and Medicare, to households. Governments also affect the economy through taxes and by providing incentives for various business activities. In addition, governments affect the economy through their collective saving, the diff erence between their revenue and spending. 1 BEA prepares e stimates of government consumption expenditures and gross investment for the federal government sector and for the state and local government sector. 2 Estimates of government consumption expenditures and gross investment by function—such as defense, health, and education —provide information on how governments allocate their funds.

In addition, t he estimates of gross investment by government provide the building blocks for the estimates of government -owned fixed assets in BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts.4 Definitions and Concepts In the NIPAs, government is treated as a producer that uses labor, capital, and intermediate inputs to provide goods and services on behalf of the general public. In its role as a producer, value added by government measures the contribution of the government sector to total value added across all industries, which is equal to GDP. In addition, government is treated as either a consumer of, or an investor in, many of the goods and services that it produces . In its role as a consumer /investor , government consumption expenditures and gross investment measures the portion of final expenditures for GDP that is accounted for by the government sector. (For a discus sion of the three methods for measuring GDP, see Chapter 2 .) In the NIPAs, the framework for government consumption expenditures explicitly recognizes government as a producer of goods and services (table 9.1). The gross output of general government consists of all of the goods and services produced by general government (see the box “General Government and Government Enterprises” on the next page ). The value of this output is measured by the cost of inputs —that is, as the sum of employee compensation, of consumption of fixed capital (CFC), and of intermediate goods and services purchased. 5 This framework is parallel to the concepts and presentation of output and intermediate inputs of private business (and of government enterprises) in BEA’s input -output accounts and GDP -by-industry accounts. H owever, 3 See Mark S. Ludwick and Benjamin A. Mandel, “ Ana lyzing Federa l Progra ms Using BEA Sta tistics: A Look a t Unemployment Insurance Benefits Pa yments ,” S urvey of Current Business 91 (September 2011): 14-17. 4 As noted in Chapter 2, fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in the production process —that is, in the production of other goods (including other fixed assets) or of services — for more than 1 year. For a description of the methodology for BEA’s estimates of the stocks and depreciation of fixed assets and of the investment flows used to derive them, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Ana lysis, Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States 1925 –97, September 2003, available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 5 CFC, or depreciation, measures the decline in the value of the stock of fixed assets due to physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, and accidental damage; however, it does not include losses caused by a natural disaster or war losses of military equipment. CFC for general government provides a partial measure of the services derived from government capital investment —that is, of the value a dded (measured as the expense incurred) as a result of using government capital goods in the production of servic es. (CFC is only a partial measure because the rate of return on government assets is assumed to be zero.)",
  "267": "CHAPTER 9: GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND GROSS INVESTMENT 9-3 for business, output is valued at market prices , and the difference between the value of output and the costs of production is equal to the net operating surplus , while for general government, the difference between output and costs, by definition, is zero (see the box “Measuring the Output of Governments” on the next page ). General Government and Government Enterprises Government output is divided into market and nonmarket output. Most government output is nonmarket in nature, meaning that services , such as public education and law enforcement, are provided without charge or with only a nominal charge. The n onmarket output of the government sector is classified in the NIPAs as general government output . In contrast , certain government entities p rovide goods and services that are sold directly to households and businesses in market transactions that recover all or a considerable portion of their operating costs . In the NIPAs, the se entities are called government enterprises . Generally, government enterprises provide services in the market economy because special circumstances —such as natural monopolies and externalities —prevent private companies from doing so. In addition, government enterprises may undertake projects of a scale too large for the private sector, or they may perform a public service that would result in operating losses if performed by the private sector . The largest government enterprise is the United States Postal Service. Other federal government enterprises include power authorities, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, and insurance enterprises, such as the Nat ional Flood Insurance Program. State and local government enterprises include housing authorities, transit systems, airports, water ports, and utilities. In the NIPAs, the value added by government enterprises (as producers of goods and services for the marketplace) is recorded in the business sector, along with that of private businesses. Sales of goods and services by government enterprises to persons are recorded as personal consumption expenditures, and those to businesses are recorded as intermediate purchases. However, the NIPA presentation of fixed investment, as with a number of other NIPA -table presentations, is split between “private” and “government” (rather than between “business” and “general government”), so the gross investment of government enterprises is included with that of general government.",
  "268": "CHAPTER 9: GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND GROSS INVESTMENT 9-4 Measuring the Output of Governments Difficult conceptual and practical problems arise in measuring the output of governments, primarily because most of this output is not sold in the marketplace (see the box “General Government and Government Enterprises”). Among these problems are the measurement of nonmarket services and the measurement of change over time in the real services provided by government. For the nonmarket services produced by general government, standard practice as recommended by the System of National Accounts is to value output in terms of the input costs incurred in production. 6 These costs include labor, materials, and supplies, and they also include the use of fixed capital. BEA uses a depreciation measure known as “consumption of fixed capital” as a partial measure of the annual services produced by the existing stock of gover nment fixed capital; this approach implicitly assumes that the net return for general government fixed assets is zero. In contrast, the cost of capital services for private market producers includes a positive net return. Alternatively, BEA could augment its measure of capital services by including a net return on assets, a change that would tend to raise the overall level of government output and consumption expenditures, and thus GDP. Several approaches have been suggested: using a private sector rate of return, a municipal bond rate, the Office of Management and Budget hurdle rate for investment, or others. 7 For real services provided by government, BEA’s estimates of real government consumption expenditures are generally based on changes in the real inputs, and thus assume that there is no change in productivity. If possible, it would be preferable to measure actual changes in the quantity or volume of the services provided, thus allowing for changes in productivity. Some services, such as national defense, are pure public goods and are difficult to quantify, even in theory. However, other services, particular ly for state and local governments, can be measured directly: for example, number of criminals arrested, number of fires extinguished, number of students educated, or number of patients treated. Some countries, including the United Kingdom, use caseload numbers as a way of quantifying real government output directly, but such measures have been subject to criticism. BEA has conducted research in a number of areas pertaining to alternative measures of real government output. 8 This research is currently preliminary, and further research is needed before these measures can be considered for implementation in the national accounts. 6 Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co - opera tion a nd Development, United Na tions, a nd the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008) : 2.59. 7 M.

Federally funded expenditures for research and development (R&D) are treated as government investment, regardless of whether the R&D is protected or made freely available to the public, because the provision of public services is part of the economic benefits generated by government R&D. 11 Federally funded R&D is supported through purchases or through grants. For purchases, ownership by the federal government is usually straightforward, because the federal government normally retains ownership of the outcome of the purchased R&D. For grants, both the federal government and the performer of the R&D c an benefit from the transaction, but they are treated as federal government R&D because the federal government receives economic benefit s and because of the difficulty in distinguishing ownership between the funder and the performer of the R&D in the source data . Table 9 .2 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from , government consumption expenditures and gross investment . 10 Unlike measures of g ross private domestic investment, government gross investment excludes the change in inventories.

Current -dollar estimates of government current receipts and expenditures that are not seasonally adjusted are also available in this section. In addition, estimates of investment by government in fixed assets are presented as part of BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts.12 Overview of Source Data and Estimating M ethods As described earlier in the handbook, the NIPA estimates, including those for government consumption expenditures and gross investment, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “ Chapter 3 : Principal Source Data ”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “ Chapter 4: Estimating Methods ”). Tables 9.A (government consumption expenditures) and 9.B (gross investment) at the end of this chapter summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current - dollar benchmark estimates, nonbenchmark annual estimates, and current quarterly estimates, as well as the quantity and price indexes, for the categories shown in NIPA table groups 3.9 and 3.10.

The budget translation provides a detailed array of NIPA expenditures by program and by type of expenditure that is used as the basis for allocating the data on program outlays from the MTS to consumption expenditures and gross investment and to other expenditures, such as social benefits and subsidies . Supplemental data from other government sources are then used to estimate spending by type of consumption expenditure and gross investment. Estimates of federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment are prepared separately for defense and for nondefense.

The estimates of wages and salaries of civilian defense employees are based on data from the BLS quarterly census of employment and w ages (QCEW), and the estimates of supplements are based on data f rom SSA, from the Office of Personnel Management , including actua rial reports for the major civilian employee retirement plans, and from the Thrift Investment Board . The estimates of CFC are derived using the perpetual inventory 14 For more information, see MP -5: Government Transactions , II-33. NIPA Translation of the Federal Budget Each year, BEA prepares a “translation” of the information in the President’s fiscal year budget into a NIPA framework ( see the annual article on the NIPA translation of the federal budget, which is usually published in the March issue of the Survey of Current Business ). Unlike the federal budget, which is a financial plan of the government, the NIPA federal -sector estimates are designed to facilitate macroeconomic analyses of the effects of federal government activity on economic activity. The translation is based on actual budget data on receipts and outlays for the preceding fiscal year and on projected and proposed receipts and outlays for the current and the next fiscal year . In translating the budget data into the framework of the NIPAs, three primary types of adjustments are made. These adjustments result in NIPA estimates of current receipts and expenditures that differ from corresponding estimates of receipts and expenditures in the budget. • Coverage adjustments account for certain transactions that are included in the budget but are excluded from the NIPAs (and vice versa). For example, the NIPA estimates include consumption of fixed capital, but the budget does not. • Netting and grossing adjustments account for certain transactions that are recorded as offsets to outlays in the budget but are recorded as receipts in the NIPAs (and vice versa). • Timing adjustments account for certain transactions that are recorded on a cash basis in the budget but are recorded on an accrual basis in the NIPAs.",

Whenever possible, the direct -pricing method is used to prepare the estimates. The estimates of defense research and development (R&D) are based on R&D expen ditures data from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) annual Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development. Nondefense estimates For most categories of nondefense consumption expenditures other than compensation and CFC , the estimates are primarily based on the federal budget data. For compensation, the estimates of wages and salaries for federal nondefense employees are based on QCEW data, and the estimates of supplements are primarily based on data from SSA , from the Office of Personnel Management, including actuarial reports for the major civilian employee retirement plans, and from the Thrift Investment Board. As above, the estimates of CFC are derived using the perpetual inventory method. For nondefense gross investment, the estimates for structures are primarily based on Census Bureau construction statistics , and the estimates for equipment are primarily based on federal budget data, supplemented with data from various federal agencies when available. The benchmark -year estimates for software are primarily based on receipts data from the Census Bureau’s economic census, and the estimates for nonbenchmark years are primarily based on receipts data from the Census Bureau’s S ervice Annual Survey The estimates for research and development (R&D) are based on R&D expenditures data from the following NSF annual surveys: the Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development and the Higher Education Research and Development Survey. As explained earlier, federal purchases of, and grants for, R&D are both treated as investment by the federal sector. State and local The annual estimates for state and local government , other than those for compensation and for CFC, are primarily based on compilations of financial data from the Census of Governments (COG) and from Surveys of State and Local G overnment Finances (GF) ; these data are supplemented with data from other sources . • The COG is a voluntary census that is conducted in the same year as the Economic Census. It covers all the states and over 90,000 local governments — including, counties, municipalities, townships, special districts, and school 15 For more infor mation on the derivation of the CFC estimates for government fixed assets, see Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, 1925 –97, September 2003.",
  "277": "CHAPTER 9: GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND GROSS INVESTMENT 9-13 districts . Data are reported for each government’s annual accounting period (fiscal year) that ends on or before June 30 of the census year. • The GF data are compiled from three sources: an enumeration of all the states, a sample survey of local governments, and data from federal government agencies. Data are r eported for each government’s fiscal year that ends on or before June 30 of the survey year. Generally, it takes about 2 years from the close of each fiscal year for final tabulations of the COG and GF data to become available. Because the fiscal years for many state and local governments do not coincide with the calendar year, the incorporation of the COG/GF data may affect the estimates for more than one calendar year. For example, in the 2020 annual update of the NIPAs, the estimates for calendar year 2017 (the third annual update of those estimates ) were prepared using final FY 2017 GF data, and preliminary FY 2018 data. The estimates for calendar year 2018 (the second annual update of those estimates) were prepared using preliminary FY 2018 data and BEA projections for FY 2019. T he estimates for calendar year 2019 (the first annual update of those estimates) were based on BEA projections for FY 2019 and FY 2020. For compensation, the estimates of wages and salaries for s tate and local government employees are based on QCEW data . Estimates of accrual -based pension contributions are drawn from a sample of actuarial reports from state pension systems. Other estimates of supplements are primarily based on data from the SSA, from the Department of Labor, from the COG/GF, and from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality . For CFC , the estimates are derived using the perpetual inventory method. Estimates by function The annual estimates of federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment by function are prepared on the basis of functional classifications for each appropriation in the federal budget. The portions of spending for all appropriations that are estimated by BEA to be consumption expenditures and gross investment are summed by budget function and then aggregated into classifications that are largely consistent with the System of National Account’s “Classification of the Functions of Government ” (COFOG). Sales of government services by appropriation are also assigned to budget functions and are subtracted from gross expenditures. In addition, a BEA estimate of CFC is added to each function. 16 The annual estimates of state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment by function are based on COG/GF data by function. These data are adjusted to conform to NIPA accounting concepts and then sorted into COFOG -based functions. 16 See Ka rl Ga lbra ith, “ Government Spending by Function: A New Presentation ,” Survey 80 (June 2000): 18–23. See also Bruce E. Baker, Pamela A. Kelly, and Brooks B.

  "278": "CHAPTER 9: GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND GROSS INVESTMENT 9-14 The COG/GF data are supplemented with data from other sources. In addition, a BEA estimate of CFC is added to each function.17 Current q uarterly estimates Source data that underlie the estimates of federal and state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment include a variety of seasonally-adjusted and unadjusted data. BEA tests the estimates for seasonality using the Census X -13 ARIM A program, and it seasonally adjusts them wherever seasonality is found. For those estimates where no seasonality is detected, the seasonally adjusted estimates are equal to the not seasonally adjusted estimates. In most cases, the not seasonally adjusted estimates of federal and state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment are derived using the same source data and methods that underlie the seasonally adjusted estimates. Where different source data are used, the difference is noted in tables 9.A and 9.B . Federal For defense consumption expenditures other than compensation and CFC , the current quarterly estimates for most categories are based on MTS data on budget outlays and on DOD data from financial reports on disbursements and are supplemented with other information from DOD when available. For nondefense consumption expenditures other than compensation and CFC , the current quarterly estimates for most categories of goods are based on MTS data on budg et outlays. The estimates for most categories of services are based on judgmental trend. Although the MTS is the primary source for many of the NIPA estimates of federal consumption expenditures, it is important to note that critical differences in definition and coverage limit the usefulness of the MTS as an early indicator of movements in the NIPA measures. For example, current transfer payments, which account for a significant part of the feder al budget, are not counted as production and are therefore excluded from the NIPA measures of consumption expenditures. 18 For compensation, the current quarterly estimates for military employees are based on DOD employment data. The estimates for civilian defense employees and for nondefense employees are based on an indicator series that is derived using changes in BLS current employment statistics. For CFC, the estimates are derived as part of the perpetual inventory method that is used to prepare BEA’s estimates of the net stocks of fixed assets. 17 See Galbraith, 18 –23, and see also Baker, Kelly, and Robinson, 5 –10. 18 For more infor mation, see the box “ The Monthly Treasury Statement and BEA’s Estimates of Federal Government Spending ,” in “ Business Situation: Advance Estimates for the Fourth Quarter of 2005 and for 2005 ,” S urvey 86 (February 2006): 6.",

For nondefense gross investment, the estimates of structures are primarily based on Census Bureau monthly construction statistics, and the estimates of equipment and intellectual property products are primarily based on government agency data or on judgmental tr end. State and local For most categories of state and local consumption expenditures other than compensation and CFC, the current quarterly estimates are derived by first preparing the quantity estimates and then “reflating ” those estimates to current dollars by multiplying them by appropriate price indexes (generally BLS producer price indexes or consumer price indexes) . For compensation, the current quarterly estimates are based on an indicator series that is derived using changes in BLS current employment statistics and changes in the BLS employment cost index . For CFC, the estimates are derived as part of the perpetual inventory method that is used to prepare BEA’s estimates of the net stocks of fixed assets. For gross investment, the estimates for structures , which account for over three - fourths of total investment, are based on Census Bureau monthly construction statistics . The estimates for investment in motor vehicles reflect monthly data on new motor vehicle registrations by state and local governments from R.L. Polk and Company. The estimates for other equipment and for intellectual property products are primarily based on judgmental trend. Quantity and price estimates The estimates of quantities purchased, or real spending, for m ost of the detailed government consumption expenditures and gross investment categories except compensation and CFC are prepared by deflati on. Under this method, the quantities are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by an appropriate price index (with the reference year set equal to 100) . For many defense categories, particularly for equipment, BEA directly prepares detailed price indexes based on DOD delivery and price information. In addition, as mentioned above, the current quarterly quantity estimates for most of the state and local government components are prepared by quantity extrapolation. The quantity and price estimates of compensation for military employees are prepared by quantity extrapolation using an indicator derived from DOD employment data, and the quantity and price estimates for federal civilian employees and for state and local government employees are prepared by quantity extrapolation using an indicator derived from BLS employment data .

It is the largest component of gross domestic income (GDI), of na tional income, and of personal income in the U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs). Compensation estimates are an integral part of the NIPAs, a set of accounts that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. e conomic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts ”). BEA’s measures of compensation provide comprehensive and consistent economic measures of the income earned by all U.S. workers. In contrast to other available measures of compensation, the NIPA measures include not just wages and salaries but also noncash benefits —such as employer contributions to pension plans, to health insurance, and to social insurance programs . Thus, the NIPA measures of compensation are particularly useful in analyses of labor’s share in the functional distribution of income. Additionally, unit labor costs— the ratio of compensation to real output—is an important indicator of potential inflation. Moreover, analys es of the components and supporting detail underlying the compensation measures are useful for considering the differences between the individual experiences of households and the picture of the economy captured in broader aggregates such as GDP and personal income . The estimates of wages and salaries —the largest component of compensation—are critical for projecting federal budgets and Social Security trust fund balances. 1 Additionally, BEA prepares associated measures of employment and hours. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS) is the principal provider of information on the labor m arket in the United States (including detailed data on employment, hours, and earnings) , BEA’s supplemental measures are consistent with the NIPA compensation measures and therefore facilitate analyses of NIPA -based compensation and productivity by employe e. These measures are described in appendix A to this chapter; they include full-time equivalent employees and hours worked. 1 See J. Steven Landefeld, Brent R. Moulton, Joel D. Platt, and Shaunda M.

  "293": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-2 Definitions and Concepts Compensation measures the total re muneration , in cash or in kind, that accrues to employee s in return for their work during the accounting period, regardless of when they are paid. As such, t he NIPA treatment of compensation is consistent with the treatment recommended by the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA), in which compensation reflects total remuneration and is measured on an accrual basis .2 Compensation consists of the earnings of employees , but it does not include the earnings of the self -employed, which the NIPAs treat as proprietors’ income (and the SNA treats as mixed income) . Compensation is equal to the sum of wage s and salar ies and of supplements to wages and salaries. Wages and salar ies, which generally account s for over 80 percent of compensation, consists of cash remuneration of labor (including sick or vacation pay, severance pay, commissions, tips, and bonuses ), and in- kind remuneration of labor such as transit subsidies and meals . Supplements to wages and salaries consists of employer payments that are made on behalf of employees but are not included in the regular wage payments provided directly to employees —specifically, employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance . Because these payments are made for the benefit of employees and because the value of the contributions is typically determined, in some fashion, by their labor, they are treated as compensation. Table 10.1 shows the kinds of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, compensation of employees. Table 10.1—Content of Compensation of Employees Category of transaction Comments Wages and salaries in cash Includes monetary wages and salaries payable by employers to employees and to corporate officers at regular intervals, including piecework payments; overtime or unusual -hour payments; payments for periods away from work due to temporary discontinuation of production, such as holidays or absences for illness; allowances for unusual location or conditions; early retirement (buyout) payments; severance pay; jury, witness , and other compensatory fees; and regular supplementary allowances, such as housing allowances. 3 Includes incentive payments, commissions, tips, and bonuses payable to employees and to corporate officers. Includes employee gains from exercising nonqualified stock options (NSOs).4 2 See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National A ccounts 2008: 7.5. For a discussion of the accrual and cash methods of accounting, see “Accounting principles” in Chapter 2. 3 The source data underlying the estimates of wages and salaries do not provide the s eparate estimates of severance payments or of payments for time away due to illness or injury that are required for excluding them from comp ensation (as the SNA recommends) , so they are included in the NIPA measures of compensation. 4 NSOs are regarded as additional, taxable, income at the time they are exercised; in contrast, incentive stock options do not require the reporting of additional income and are taxed as long -term capital gains when sold. The detailed data required for treating NSOs as compensation of employees when the options are granted (as the SNA recommends) are not currently available. Instead, NSOs are valued at the time that they are exercised, and the difference between the market price at the time of the exercise and the price paid by the employee at the time of the exercise is recorded as wages and salaries.

Wages and salaries in kind Includ es employer -provided in-kind earnings , such as transit subsidies, meals, and lodging. Excludes goods or services that employers must provide in order for employees to perform their work, which are treated as intermediate expenditures by the employer .

Includes employer contributions for government social insurance: old age, survivors, and disability insurance (social security); hospital insurance; unemployment insurance; railroad retirement; pension benefit guaranty; veterans life insurance; workers’ compensation; military medical insurance; and temporary disability insurance. Employer s provide employees with pension benefits largely through two mechanisms : • Defined contribution plans provide benefits during retirement based on the amount of money that has accumulated in an employee’s account as a result of employer and employee contributions to the plans and the inc ome earned from investment of the plans’ assets . • Defined benefit plans provide benefits during retirement based on a formula that typically depends on an employee’s length of service and average pay, among other factors. To fund promised benefits to retire es, defined benefit plans primarily rely on contributions from employers and employees and on the income earned on the financial assets that the plans hold . The contributions made by employers to both types of plans are included in supplements to wages and salaries ; the interest and dividend income earned on the plans’ financial assets are included in personal interest income . The NIPAs provide two measures of compensation in order to distinguish the compensation earned by all of the employees of resident U.S. employers from the compensation earned by resident U.S. employees from all employers. “Compensation of employees, paid” is the NIPA measure of the compensation paid by U.S. resident employers to their resident and nonresident e mployees.

That is, it excludes compensation paid to the rest of the world, and it includes compensation received from the rest of the world. Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy. In the seven summ ary accounts of the NIPAs, “ compensation of employees, paid ” appears as a component of GDI in the Domestic Income and Product Account (account 1) and “ compensation of employees ” appears in the Personal Income and Outlay Account (account 3) as a component of personal income. 6 Additionally, as “compensation of employees” reflects the compensation liabilities of both resident and nonresident employers, it appears as a component of national income.7 The NIPAs present current -dollar annual estimates of GDI by type of income , national income by type of income, and national income by sector and legal form of organization. • The presentation of GDI by type of income includ es “compensation of employees , paid” and selected aggregate components —wages and salar ies to persons , wages and salaries to the rest of the world , and supplements to wages and salaries . • The presentation of national income by type of income includes “compensation of employees” and selected aggregate components —wages and salar ies for government and for the aggregate of all other sectors and supplements to wages and salaries from employer co ntributions for employee pension and insurance funds and from employer contributions for government social insurance . • The presentation of national income by sector and legal form of organization also includes “compensation of employees ” and selected aggregate components —wages and salar ies and supplements to wages and salaries . Additionally, a nnual estimates of “ compensation of employees,” wages and salar ies, and the major components of supplements to wages and salaries are presented by industry. 5 Compensation paid to the rest of the world consists of compensation paid to foreign residents temporarily working in the United States (including undocumented migratory workers) and to Canadian and Mexican workers who commute to work in the United States. Compensation received from the rest of the world consists of compensation received by U.S. residents temporarily working abroad, working in foreign diplomatic installations, or working for international organizations in the United States, and by workers f rom the United States who commute to Mexico or Canada. 6 In addition, compensation of general government employees is a product -side component of government consumption expenditures and gross investment in account 1; see “ Chapter 9: Government Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment ” for more information on the NIPA presentation of government as both a consumer/investor and a producer and on the measurement of government output as the sum of the cost of its inputs. 7 For a discussion of the relationship between GDP, gross national product , national income, and other important NIPA aggregates, see “Major NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 2.

  "298": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-7 of Labor Statistics .” A reproduction of table 7.18 appears below in the section “Adjustments to the QCEW data.” Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier in the handbook, the NIPA estimates, including those for compensation of employees, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “ Chapter 4 : Estimating Methods ”). Specifically, the compensation estimates are based on statistical reports from federal agencies including BLS and the Department of the Treasury, on federal budget publications and other administrative and regulatory agency reports , and on reports from private organizations (such as trade associations ). Tables 10.A (wages and salaries), 10.B (employer contributions for pension and insurance funds ), and 10.C (employer contributions for government social insurance) at the end of this chapter summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the annual estimates and the current quarterly estimates of compensation and its components . The tables follow the categories shown in NIPA tables 6.3 (for wage s and salar ies), 6.11 (for employer contributions for pension and insurance funds) , and 3.6 (for employer contributions for government social insurance). 15 The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Annual estimates “Compensation of employees , paid” is measured as the sum of wage s and salar ies and of supplements to wages and salaries. The primary source of information on annual wages and salar ies is the QCEW; the sources of information on supplements to wages and salaries are as varied as the programs themselves. Wages and salar ies The benchmark and annual estimates are derived using the same source data and methodologies. For private industry employees and for civilian employees of federal 15 In NIPA table 6.3. Wages and Salaries by Industry, , total wage s and salar ies on a national income basis —which includes wages and salaries received from the rest of the world and excludes wages and salaries paid to the rest of the world —is shown on line 1. The industry- speci fic estimates, beginning with “Domestic industries” on line 2, include payments to the rest of the world (and exclude receipts from the rest of the world) in order to accurately reflect each industry’s total wage and salary liability. The offsetting entry, total wages and salaries paid to the rest of the world netted against wages and salaries received from the rest of the world, is shown on line 97. In NIPA table 3.6. Contributions for Government Social Insurance , the entry “Rest -of-the-world contributions” on line 32 recognizes the employer and employee contributions for government social insurance from residents of the U.S. territories of Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and of the U.S. commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. In the NIPAs, these are treated as contributions from “nonresidents” (see the section “Geographic coverage” in Chapter 2) and as a consequence, they are not included in the NIPA estimates of total supplements to wages and salaries and are not shown in table 10.C of this chapter .",
  "299": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-8 government, of state and local general government , and of the U . S. Postal Service, the estimates are primarily based on the QCEW . Estimates for the military and for other government enterprises are discussed below in the section “Adjustments to the QCEW data.” QCEW data on wages and salar ies are generally available for all four quarters of the previous year at the time of the annual update of the NIPAs. The QCEW is a federal -state cooperative program in which state employment agencies compile and report to BLS the monthly data on employment and the quarterly data on total and taxable wages that are reported to the states each quarter by private industries on quarterly tax returns and by federal agencies and state and local governments on similar reports for employees covered by s tate unemployment i nsurance (UI) laws or by the Unemployment Compens ation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. These data cover about 97 percent of employees on nonfarm payrolls. BLS tabulates the data by geographical categories (county, metropolitan statistical area , combined statistical area , state, and the nation), by six -digit NAICS industry level, and by ownership sectors (private industry, federal government, state government, or local government). The composition of wages reported to state employment agencies is generally consistent with the NIPA definition of wa ges and salar ies. The data are on a disbursement basis; they reflect the total wages and salaries paid during a calendar quarter, regardless of when the services were performed ( although a few state laws specify that wages be reported on an accrual basis) . Conversely, t he NIPAs record compensation and its components on an accrual basis ; they reflect the total wages and salaries earned during the period, regardless of when they were paid. In most years, the pattern of wage and salary accruals and disbursemen ts is relatively stable, with no difference between the measures of accruals and disbursements. 16 However, when there is evidence of a substantial departure from the usual pattern, BEA may incorporate a timing adjustment to better reflect the earnings accr ued in each perio d. When these adjustments are made, they are recorded in the annual wage reconciliation table (NIPA table 7.18) discussed below in the section “Adjustments to the QCEW data.” 17 BEA sums the quarterly QCEW data for each industry to derive annual estimates and makes additional adjustments to account for misreporting of wages on employment tax returns and for differences in coverage and in definitions (see the section “Adjustments to the QC EW 16 As a simple example, if wages and salaries accrued annually include bonuses that typically equal $1 00, with one - half of the bonuses paid in the current year and one -half paid in the following year, then each year’s disbursed wages will include a $50 bonus payment accrued in the current year and a $50 bonus payment accrued in the previous year; the total bonuses paid in each year —$100—equals the bonuses accrued. 17 Prior to the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, the NIPAs presented a third compensation measure, “compensation of employees, received” that reflected estimates of wages and salaries on a disbursement basis. An entry for “wage and salary accruals less disbursements” (WALD) in the national income tables reconciled the two accrual -based measures with this disbursement -based measure. In practice, there was often little information on the timing differences between accruals and disbursements, and the measure of WALD was typically zero. The new treatment, introduced during the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs , discontinued the disbursement -based measure of “compensation of employees, received” and the measures of WALD in order to better align transactions of the personal income and outlays account with those of the private enterprise income account, to simplify the presentation of wages and sala ries with in the accounts, and to help bring the NIPAs in line with recommendations of the SNA. See “Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the Na tional Income and Product Accounts: Changes in Definitions and Presentations ,” Survey 93 (March 2013): 13- 39.",
  "300": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-9 data”); these adjustments account for about 5 percent of the NIPA estimate of wages and salar ies. BEA uses industry payroll data from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census to aggregate the estimates across industries and levels of government to prepare es timates of total wage s and salar ies by legal form and sector . Supplements to wages and salaries The benchmark and annual estimates are derived using the same source data and methodologies. Employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds consist s of the contributions made by private or government employers to privately administered retirement and insurance pr ograms and by government employers to government employee pension plans a nd to publicly administered government employee insurance programs. Employer contributions for government social insurance consist s of the contributions made by private and public employers to other publicly administered programs that provide certain social benefits, such as social security and Medicare. 18 For employer contributions for pension funds, supplements are estimated by type of fund—defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans —and by employer —private plans and government employee plans. For defined contributions plans, future benefit s are determined by the contributions made by employers and employees into the plan and by the income earned on the financial assets that the plans hold; therefore, actual contributions reflect the accrual accounting method. For defined benefit plans, future benefit entitlements are determined independently of actual contributions and may diffe r from them. 19 Thus, in order to reflect the accrual accounting basis , the NIPA measures of employer contributions to defined benefit plans reflect actual contributions and—when actual contributions differ from the entitlements earned in the period—imputed contributions to reflect the value of the employers’ liability for entitlements and for the administrative expenses of the plan that are not fulfilled by actual contributions .20 The measurement of employer contributions for both types of pla ns are described below and in table 10.B .21 18 For descriptions of the government social insurance programs included in the NIPA measure of employer contributions for government social insurance, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, MP -5: Government Transactions (Methodology Papers: U.S. National Income and Product Accounts, September 2005). 19 This is especially true in cases where the actual contributions made by employers are sporadic. For example, employers sometimes skip contributions when the plans have enjoyed unusually good investment returns; conversely, employers sometimes make large “catch up” contributions to pay dow n unfunded benefit obligations. 20 In periods where actual contributions exceed the total liability of employers, imputed employer contributions will be negative. 21 The measurement of defined benefit pension plans on an accrual basis was introduced as part of the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs to better align pension -related compensation with th e timing of when employees earned the benefit entitlements and to be consistent with the recommendations of the SNA. The accrual - based estimates also avoid the volatility that arises when sporadic cash payments made by employers into defined benefit pension plans are used to measure compensation. For detailed information on accrual -based measures of benefit entitlements and contributions, see “ Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: Changes in Definitions and Presentations ,” Survey 93 (March 2013): 13 -39 and Marshall B. Reinsdorf and David G. Lenze, “ Defined Benefit Pensions and Household Income and Wealth,” Survey 89 (August 2009): 50- 62. With the 2014 annual update of the NIPAs, defined contribution pension plans were also treated as part of the same subsector. With the 2018 comprehensive update, the valuation of state and local defined benefit pensions was changed from an accumulated benefit obligation basis to a projected benefit obligation basis.",
  "301": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-10 For employer contributions to defined contribution pension plans, t he estimates are primarily based on survey and administrative data from government agencies —including t he Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, the Census Bureau, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) , the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) , the Employment Benefits and Security Administration (EBSA), and the De partment of Health and Human Services (HHS) . For employer contributions to defined benefit pension plans , the NIPA estimates are based on actuarial estimates of the present value of claims to benefits accrued through service in the current period—commonly called normal costs —primarily from PBGC , EBSA, OPM , the Department of Treasury , the Department of Defense, and reports from state and local pension plans . The employers’ portion of the liability for the se claims —referred to as employers’ normal costs —reflects actual and imputed employer contributions . For privately sponsored defined benefit plans, estimates of employers’ normal costs are based on actuarial estimates of employers’ normal costs provided by the PBGC from data collected on IRS form 5500. T he PBGC adjusts the estimates to include administrative expenses , and BEA adjusts the PBGC estimates to reflect a common discount rate based on the average AAA corporate bond rat e published by Moody’s Investors Service . For federal government civilian employee defined benefit pension plans, estimates of employers’ normal costs are based on OPM data published in the annual actuarial reports of the major civilian retirement plans , supplemented by data from the Department of Treasury . The estimates of employers’ normal costs are scaled up slightly to account for smaller retirement plans such as those for employees of the Foreign Service and the Coast Guard that are not included in the source data. For the military defined bene fit plans, estimates of employers’ normal costs are based on Department of Defense data on normal cost rates and payroll . For state and local employee defined benefit pension plans, the estimates of employers ’ normal costs are based on the service costs and employee contribution data reported in state and local government financial reports . BEA adjusts the estimates to reflect the same discount rate that is used for measures of privately sponsored defined benefit plans.

For the published aggregates of supplements to wages and salaries —that is, employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance —seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates are derived as the sum of the components (or some aggregate level of the components) that are, in most cases, prepared by extrapolation, either judgmentally or by using an indicator s eries (for an explanation of this method, see “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in Chapter 4). 22 Wages and salar ies As noted above, the primary source for the annual estimates of private wage s and salar ies is QCEW data. Because t hese quarterly data are generally available 5 months after the end of a quarter, the estimates of private wages and salaries for the quarters for which the QCEW data are not yet available are derived by averaging the current monthly estimates . 23 The current monthly estimates are extrapolated for each industry from the historical monthly estimates , which are in turn based on the most recent quarterly QCEW data that are available; the industry estimates are then summed to derive the monthly estimates for total wages and sal aries . The extrapolation is based on the most recent monthly data from the BLS current employment statistics (CES) program and is calculated as the growth rate for employment times average weekly hours times and average hourly earnings . Similarly, once the QCEW data are incorporated into the quarterly estimates, the monthly estimates are interpolated based on the same CES indicator series. For example, the end -of-November release of Personal Income and Outlays for October contain s monthly estimates of wages and salar ies for July through October that are CES extrapolations of revised monthly estimates for the second quarter that are based on newly available QCEW data. In turn, the end-of-November release of GDP for the third quarter ( second estimate) con tains third -quarter estimates of wages and salaries that are derived by averaging the monthly Personal Income and Outlay estimates. 22 Most of the source data that are used for extrapolation are seasonally adjusted; when this is not the case, BEA seasonally adjusts data that display seasonali ty (see the section “Seasonal adjustment” in Chapter 2). In cases where estimates are extrapolated without the use of indicator series, there is no monthly or quarterly seasonality. 23 The monthly estimates of personal income, including compensation, are expressed at annual rates ; consequently, the current quarterly estimates, also expressed at annual rates, may be derived by avera ging the monthly estimates .",
  "303": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-12 In general, the release of the “third” current quarterly estimate of GDP marks the last opportunity to revise most NIPA estimates until the next annual update . However, because of the importance of the QCEW as a data source and because of the 5 -month lag in its availability, an exception is made for private wages and salaries and for private employer contributions for gove rnment social insurance (for which the estimates are generally based on estimates of private wages and salaries). As part of the “second” current quarterly release of GDP, the preceding quarter’s estimates for these series and for affected income- side aggr egates are revised in order to incorporate the newly available QCEW data.24 Thus, c ontinuing with the example above, the end-of-November release of GDP for the third quarter (second estimate) also contain s revised estimates of wages and salaries for the second quarter that are based on newly available QCEW data. The months of the second quarter are interpolated based on the QCEW -derived quarterly control. For federal and for state and local government employees, the current quarterly estimates are derived by summing monthly extrapolations from the most recent annual estimates. Federal civilian estimates for both general government and government enterprises are extrapolated using an indicator series that is based primarily on CES employment data . Federal military estimates are extrapolated using Department of Defense employment data. State and local government e stimates for both general government and government enterprises are extrapolated using an indicator series that is based on CES employment data and on information on the change in the cost of labor from the BLS employment cost index. Supplements to wages and sala ries Current quarterly estimates of employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds are released only for the aggregate, which is prepared as the sum of the components or aggregate levels of the components . In most cases, the component es timates are prepared by judgmentally projecting annual estimates into the next year and then interpolating those projected annual estimates into quarterly (and monthly) estimates. Current quarterly estimates of employer contributions for government soci al insurance funds are also prepared as the sum of its components. These components are generally extrapolated from the annual estimates to quarterly (and monthly) estimates using indicator series, so they are made available as part of the NIPA underlying detail (see the section “Recording in the NIPAs”). In most cases, the indicator series are based on NIPA wage and salary estimates or the component estimates are extrapolated without an indicator but with information from Budget projections of relevant outlays. As mentioned earlier, the estimates of 24 This procedure was introduced as part of the 2002 annual update in order to reduce the magnitude of revisions to the estimates of wages and salari es. (See the box “Revisions to Wages and Salaries and to Profits” in Eugene P. Seskin and Stephanie H. McCulla, “Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts ,” Survey 82 (August 2002): 24- 25.) Affected aggregates include gross domestic income, the statistical discrepancy, gross national income, national income, personal income, disposable personal income, personal taxes, personal saving, gross (national) saving, compe nsation, and gross product of corporate business. Other components that are closely linked to wages and salaries, such as personal current taxes and employer contributions for government social insurance, are also revised. Product -side series, including go vernment compensation, which is a component of GDP, are not revised.",

The not seasonally adjusted ( NSA) estimates of compensation of employees are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted estimates, using not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators. Adjustments to the QCEW data The QCEW data on wages and salar ies are largely consistent with the concepts and definitions underlying the NIPA estimates of wages and salaries . However, in deriving the annual estimates of wage s and salar ies for the NIPAs, BEA adjusts the QCEW data to account for misreporting of wages (including tips) on employment tax returns and for differences in coverage and in definitions.

Adjustments are made to the QCEW data to account for wages and salari es that are underreported on employment tax returns , for tips that are underreported, and for wages and salaries that are not reported at all because the employers fail to file an employment tax return. • The estimates of underreported income are based on audits of individual employment tax returns undertaken as part of the IRS National Research Program (NRP) for the 2001, 2006, 2008- 2010, 2011- 2013, 2014- 2016 and 2017- 2019 (projected) as well as tax gap measures for various years from the previous IRS TCMP studies . 25 • The adjustment for underreported tips or gratuities is derived in the preparation of BEA’s input -output accounts for industries —primarily accommodations, food service s, taxi s, barber shops , and beauty salons —where tips are a significant factor in compensation. The adjustment is based on the assumption that not all tips are included in the wages and salaries reported on the employment tax returns , and it is derived using information on industry sales and information on “tip rat es” from the IRS. • The estimates of nonreported income are based on “exact -match” studies that the Census Bureau provides to BEA . These studies match records from the Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the Census Bureau for BLS, with individual IRS tax returns in order to estimate nonfiler income for individuals.

This entry reflects the addition of the NIPA estimate for wages and salaries of military personnel and for various other government wage and salary payments not captured by the QCEW. The compensation paid to military personnel is based on Budget data and include s cash wages as well as in -kind compensation such as uniform and housing allowances and rations. The wage and salary information in the Budget is available on a fiscal year basis; actual wage and salary expenses are provided for one year , and pr ojections are provided for the current year and the budget year (for example, the FY2015 Budget provides actual expenses for FY2013 and projected expenses for FY2014 and FY2015). BEA converts the fiscal year estimates to a calendar year basis by allocating one quarter of the estimate for a given fiscal year to the previous year and three quarters to the given year. Additional government -related adjustments are made for students and their spouses employed by public colleges or unive rsities, for elected officials and members of the judiciary, for intelligence agents, for interns employed by publicly administered hospitals and by social service agencies, for judicial fees paid to jurors and witnesses, for compensation of prison inmates , and for marriage and license fees paid to justices of the peace.

Adjustments for differences between the QCEW and the NIPA definitions of wages and salaries include the following: • An adjustment to include compensation received from foreign employers and to exclude compensation paid to foreigners in order to make the measure consistent with national income , derived from ITA estimate s of compensation received from foreigners . Alternatively, in gross domestic income tables, the ITA estimate of compensation paid to the rest of the world is included and the ITA estimate of compensation received from the rest of the world is excluded. The ITA estimate s of compensation received from, and paid to, foreigners are based mostly on da ta from foreign statistical authorities and from the IRS, as well as various demographic and labor market data from the USDA and the Department of Labor.26 • An adjustment to include employer contributions to “cafeteria plans ” that are excluded from the QCEW data for private industries and for state and local governments when state laws do not count them as wages for unemployment insurance purposes. These plans allow participating employees to use a portion of their salaries on a pre -tax basis to pay for heal th insurance and for “flexibl e spending accounts ,” which reimburse employees for medical care and for dependent daycare. The adjustment is based on data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and on trade source data. 27 This adjustment is not needed for federal employer contributions to these plans because they are included in the QCEW data for all states. Adjustment for timing for accrual basis (line 6 ). This adjustment accounts for differences in the timing of wage and salary disbursements from QCEW data and the accrual basis underlying the NIPA measure of wages and salaries . A positive adjustment reflects a net amount of compensation that was earned, but not actually received (and therefore not reflected in the source data) during the period, and a negative adjustment reflects a net amount of compensation that was paid (and reflected in the source data), but not actually earned, during the period. In practice, as reliable source data are generally lacking on these differences, timing adjustments are infrequent. 26 For more information on the sources and methods for estimating compensation paid to and received from the rest of the world, see the section “Compensation of Employees” in “ U.S. International Transactions Accounts: Concepts and Estimation Methods ,” at www.bea.gov . 27 For more information, see Clinton P.

The data reflect the number of workers covered by the Unemployment Insurance ( UI) or the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees ( UCFE ) programs and are derived from quarterly r eports filed by almost every employer in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All filled positions are included , whether full or part -time, tempo rary, or permanent ; as such it is likely that a multi- job holder will be counted two or more times in QCEW data. The estimates include foreign professional workers and undocumented migratory workers employed temporarily in the United States; these are clas sified as “Rest of world.” The NIPA measures of employment by industry from 2001 forward are classified according to the North American Industry Classification System; prior to 2001, the measures are classified according to the Standard Industrial Classif icatio n system . Recording in the NIPAs The NIPAs present current -dollar annual estimates of employment and hours by industry in the following tables : 6.4 Full-Time and Part -Time Employees by Industry 6.5 Full Time Equivalent Employees by Industry 6.6 Wages and Salaries per Full Time Equivalent Employee by Industry 6.7 Self-Employed Persons by Industry 6.8 Persons Engaged In Production by Industry 6.9 Hours Worked by Full -Time and Part -Time Employees by Industry Overview of Source Data an d Estimating Methods The NIPAs present the following annual employment estimates: Full- and part -time employees by industry.

The measure is adjusted as described in the section on “Adjustments to the QCEW employment data.” Full-time equivalent employees by industry. This measure equals the number of employees on full -time schedules plus the number of employees on part -time schedules converted to a full -time basis. For the current year, the number of nonfederal full -time equivalent employees in each industry is the product of the total number of employees, from the QCEW, and the ratio of avera ge weekly hours per employee for all employees to average weekly hours per employee on full -time schedules, based on data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Census Bureau for BLS. For previous years, the number of full -time equivalen t employees in each industry is the product of the total number of employees and the ratio of full time employees to total employees, also from the CPS. An industry’s full -time equivalent employment will be less than the number of its employees on full - and part -time schedules, unless it has no part -time employees. For federal employees and for the military , the number of full-time equivalent employees is based on data from the Budget of the United States Government. 28 Wages and salaries per full -time equivalent employee by industry.

For employees excluding the military, thi s measure is derived as the product of total full - and part -time employees and the number of average weekly hours per employee for all employees, multiplied by 52 weeks, based on BLS data. For the military, this measure is derived as the product of the num ber of active duty military members and an assumed number of hours per year, plus the product of the number of reservists and an assumed number of hours per year. 28 For federal civilian employees, the data are from the Histor ical Tables of the budget, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical- tables/.",

However, as with the QCEW wage and salary data, BEA makes adjustments to make the data fully consistent with NIPA concepts, definitions, and coverage . First, B EA adjusts employment so that it remains consistent with the wages and salaries estimates adjusted for misreporting . Second, though t he QCEW program provide s partial information on agricultural industries and on employees in private households, BEA uses additional source data to estimate most or all of the employment for the same industries for which wages and salaries are adjusted : farms, farm labor contractors, private households, private elementary and secondary schools , religious membership organizations, railroads, military, and U.S. residents who are employed by international organizations and by foreign embassies and consulates in the United States. Adjustment for misreporting. An adjustment is made to the QCEW dat a on private sector employment for consistency with the misreporting adjustments made to wages and salaries. That is, employment is adjusted in accordance with the adjustment to wages and salaries so that the proportional relationship between them remains the same. Adjustment for employment that is not covered or not fully covered by UI and UCFE programs . An adjustment is made to add the employment of several industries that are not covered or that are not fully covered by the UI and UCFE programs. Following the entries in table 10.2, the adjustments are: Government . Military employment is measured as the number of military personne l assigned to active duty units plus the number of military reserve unit members. The estimate is based on data from the Budget . Additional government -related adjustments are made for the employment of students and their spouses by public colleges or universities, for elected official s and members of the judiciary, for intelligence agents, and for interns employed by publicly administered hospitals and by social service agencies. These adjustments, which comprise only a very small share of the total government adjustment, are based on corresponding adjustments underlying BEA’s estimates of state personal income. 29 Other . Other adjustments include estimates for employees not fully covered by the QCEW, as follows: • for federal government enterprises based on supplemental Budget data. • for farms , based on quarterly data from USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service on farm labor. • for farm labor contractors, based on corresponding adjustments underlying BEA’s state personal income estimates based on USDA data on expenditures for fa rm contract labor. 29 For more information on BEA’s estimates of state personal incom e, see “State Personal Income and Employment ” at www.bea.gov .",

The measure is an integral part of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “ Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts ”). BEA’s measure of nonfarm proprietors’ income provides a comprehensive and consistent economic measure of the income earned by all U.S. unincorporated nonfarm businesses. The featured measure – nonfarm proprietors’ income with inventory valuation adjustment and capital consumption adjustment – is not directly affected by changes in tax laws, is adjusted for nonreported and misreported income , and excludes dividend income, capital gains and losses, and other financing flows and adjustments, such as deduction for “bad debt.” Thus , the measure is a particularly useful analytical indicator of the health of non corporate businesses and provides both a complement and contrast to the NIPA measure of corporate profits . Nonfarm proprietors’ income is a component of private enterprise income and personal income in the summary NIPA tables. Definitions and Concepts Nonfarm proprietors’ income measures the income, before deducting income taxes, of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and other private nonfarm businesses that are organized for profit but that are not classified as corporations. S ole proprietorships are businesses owned by a",
  "321": "CHAPTER 11: NONFARM PROPRIETORS ’ INCOME 11-2 single individual. Partnerships include most associations of two or more of: individuals , corporations , noncorporate organizations that are organized for profit , or of other private businesses. Other private businesses are made up of tax -exempt cooperatives , including credit unions, mutual insurance companies, and rural utilities providing utility services and farm marketing and purchasing services. The NIPA measures of national income and gross domestic income and their components present the incomes that accrue to factors of production as a result of their contribution to production. For corporations, these incomes are separately reported in detailed financial accounts and in tax returns , and they are reflected in the NIPA measures of corporate profits, compensation of employees, and net interest (as well as taxes ). Unincorporated businesses, on the other hand, are able to move assets freely between business and personal accounts with little, if any, reporting requirements, and tax liabilities are not separated between unincorporated businesses and their owners. In fac t, the income of unincorporated businesses is generally reported on individual income tax returns; while compensation paid to employees is separately reported, the income of the business is not distinguished from the labor of the business owner and therefore reflects the incomes that accrue as a result of the owner’s own labor and entrepreneurship. Similarly, dividend and interest incomes are separately reported but do not distinguish between business and personal receipts. The measure of nonfarm proprietors’ income is therefore a critical measure for analyses of the shares of income , as it reflects factor incomes that are not separately captured by the other income measures. Reflecting the concepts of national economic accounting, nonfarm proprietors’ income in the NIPAs is defined as that arising from current production. This income is measured as receipts less expenses as defined in federal tax law, but with several important differences. Table 11.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, nonfarm proprietors’ income. 1 1 The NIPA measures of proprietors’ income are closely related to the measures for “mixed income” in the Sys tem of National Accounts (SNA). However, the SNA definition of mixed income is broa der than proprietors’ income and includes rental income of persons, noncorpor ate current transfer payments, and portions of net interest pai d and consumption of fixed capital. At the same time, the SNA has a more narrow definition of the entities earning mi xed income that excludes limite d lia bility partnerships a nd any enterprises for which it is possible to separate all a ssets, including financial a ssets, into those that belong to the household and those that belong to the business.

Includes all U.S. nonfarm partnerships that are or would be required to file IRS Form 1065 (U.S. Partnership Return of Income). Includes all other U.S. unincorporated private businesses — tax-exempt cooperatives providing utility services and farm marketing and purchasing services . Receipts include taxable income from entities otherwise classified as nonprofits. Receipts exclude capital gains and dividends and monetar y interest received by nonfinancial business. Receipts exclude rental income received by persons that are not primarily engaged in the real estate business . Expenses exclude deductions for bad debt, depletion, and capital losses. Expenses exclude expensing for, and include depreciation of, intellectual property products (including software ) mining exploration, shafts, and wells , and rental clothing and videos . Inventory valuation adjustment Inventory withdrawals are valued at current cost. Capital consumption adjustment Depreciation is valued at current cost. BEA uses data collected on a tax -accounting basis as the primary source of information for nonfarm proprietors’ income . These data are based on well -specified, consistent accounting definitions that, in general, parallel NIPA concepts and definitions. In addition, tax-accounting tabulations are comprehensive, covering all unincorporated businesses . However, the data are not entirely suitable for implementing the NIPA concept of income from current production. Consequently, BEA’s procedure for estimating nonfarm proprietors’ income mainly consists of adjusting, incorporating, and supplementing these data.2 The featured measure of nonfarm proprietors’ income includes two additional adjustments —the inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) and the capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj)—made to ensure that the measure reflects income from current production. The IVA reflects the fact that as prices change, businesses that value inventory withdrawals at original acquisition (historical) costs may realize inventory profits or losses. In the NIPAs, these gains or losses that result from holding goods in inventory are not considered income from current production and thus are removed from busine ss income. The IVA converts the tax -accounting value of inventory withdrawals, which is based on a mixture of historical and current costs, to a 2 See the section “Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods .”",
  "323": "CHAPTER 11: NONFARM PROPRIETORS ’ INCOME 11-4 current -cost basis by removing the gain or loss that results from valuing these withdrawals at prices of earlier periods.3 Depreciation measured on a tax -accounting basis must be adjusted to reflect consistent economic -accounting measures that are valued at current -replacement cost. The CCAdj is a two - part adjustment that (1) converts valuations of depreciation that are based on a mixture of service lives and depreciation patterns specified in the tax code to valuations that are based on uniform service lives and empirically based depreciation patterns ; and (2) l ike the IVA, converts the measures of depreciation to a current -cost basis by removing from profits the gain or loss that arises from valuing the depreciation of fixed assets at the prices of earlier periods. A reconciliation of the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS) measures of depreciation and BEA’s measures of consumption of fixed capital for corporations and for proprietors are provided in NIPA “Table 7.13 Relation of Consumption of Fixed Capital in the National Income and Product Accounts to Depreciation and Amortization as Published by the Internal Revenue Service .” 4 The composition of proprietors’ income with IVA and CCAdj is illustrated below. 2017 estimate (billions of dollars) Nonfarm proprietors’ income with IVA and CCAdj 1,387.6 Nonfarm proprietors income without IVA and CCAdj 1,088.1 IVA -7.2 CCAdj 306.8 For consistent accounting a t historical cost 350.0 For current -cost valuation -43.3 Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy.

Because total depreciation cannot exceed the amount of the investment, the amount of depreciation remaining to b e taken in future years will be reduced. As depreciation will be increa sed during the “bonus” span and lowered thereafter , and because depreciation is an expense in calculating net income , NFPI will be understated during the “bonus” span and overstated thereafter. BEA’s featured measure of n onfarm proprietors’ income –that is, NFPI with IVA and CCAdj —are not affected by bonus depreciation because the CCAdj replaces tax -based depreciation with economic depreciation —that is, consumption of fixed capital (CFC). BEA’s estimates of bonus deprecation are published and are based on data fr om the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) of t he U.S. Department of Treasury and on other source data.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also prepares measures of nonfarm proprietors’ income; s pecifically, estimates of the net profit (less loss) of nonfarm proprietorships and partnerships. The estimates are derived from tax returns as part of the Statistics of Income (SOI) program and form the basis of BEA’s nonfarm statistics ; BEA presents the relationship between them in “Table 7.1 4 Relation of Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income in the National Income and Prod uct Accounts to Corresponding Measures as Published by the Internal Rev enue Service.” A reproduction of table 7.14 appears in the technical note at the end of this chapter, “ Adjustments to IRS Source Data for Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income .” Additionally, as noted above, NIPA table 7.13 presents the relationship between IRS measures of depreciation and BEA measures of consumption of fixed capital for corporations and for nonfarm sole proprietors and partnerships . Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier in the handbook, most of the NIPA estimates are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “ Chapter 4: Estimating Methods ”). Table 11.A at the end of this chapter summarizes the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the most recent annual estimates and the current quarterly estimates of nonfarm proprietors’ income for the industry categories shown in NIPA table 6.12; the benchmark and other annual estimates for all industries are derived using the same source data and methods and are described below . The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Annual estimates (except most recent year) Tabulations of income from individual income tax returns are prepared by the IRS and are published in the fall issues of the Statistics of Income Bulletin .

For partnership income (except for those primarily engaged in real estate), the starting point is the IRS measure of “ordin ary business income (loss) ; for the income of sole proprietorships or partnerships that are primarily engaged in real estate, the starting point is the IRS measure of “net rental real estate income (loss)” and “other net rental income (loss)” from Form 1065 schedule K. 8 Adjustments to the IRS tax return data The by-industry IRS totals are adjusted by BEA as described below; a reconciliation of the IRS and the NIPA measures is prese nted annually in NIPA table 7.14, which is reproduced for the year 2017 below and discussed in detail in the technical note at the end of this chapter .

These adjustments are published annually in “Table 7.14. Relation of Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income in the National Income and Product Accounts to Corresponding Measures as Published by the Internal Revenue Servic e.” A reproduction of th is table is shown below in table 11. 3. Adjustments to IRS Source Data for Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income The starting point for the derivation of the estimates of nonfarm proprietors’ income is “Net profit (less loss) of nonfarm proprietorships and partnerships, plus payments to partners, IRS” shown on line 1 in table 11. 3 below. This measure is based on the all -industry total of the IRS item “net income less deficit” obtained from the Statistics of Income Bulletin. (This item differs from the IRS measure of total business receipts less total business deductions by the amount of “passive” activity losses that are excluded from the IRS measure of total deductions but that are included in the IRS measure of deficit .)

Adjustment for misreporting on income tax returns (line 2) . Adjustments are made to the SOI data to account for income that is underreported on employment tax returns and for income that is not reported at all because the individuals fail to file a tax return ; together, these adjustments have accounted for approximately 50 percent of proprietors’ and partnership income in the NIPAs since the 1970s . There is an additional misreporting adjustment offset to remove wages that are incorrectly reported as income. This adjustment is part of the post -tabulation amendments and revisions on line 3. Underreported income. The estimates of underreported income are based on audits of individual employment tax returns undertaken as part of the IRS National Research Program (NRP) for 2001, 2006, 2008 -2010 , 2011-2013 , 2014 -2016 and 2017-2019 (projected) as well as tax gap measures for various years from the previous IRS TCMP studies. Estimates of the underreporting of the income of sole proprietors are taken directly from the IRS studies for the years covered by the studies. The underreporting of income by partnerships is not separately identified in the IRS reports but is combined with the underreported income of S corporations. The partnership share of this measure is derived from the partnership share of reported business",

The estimates of nonreported income are based on “exact -match” studies from the Census Bureau for various years before 2003 and each year from 2003 forward . These studies match records from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey with individual IRS tax returns and provide industry-level measures of the total self -employment nonfarm income f or those persons with validated social security numbers that did not file tax returns.

They include an adjustment to include the capital gains or losses of real estate developers because their function is trade rather than holding assets for profits and therefore reflects income from production; the exclusion of Section 1231 adjustments – that is, the capital gains or losses on real property because they do not reflect income from current production; and the inclusion of the income earned by newspaper car riers that is excluded from the SOI data.",

Audits of individual employment tax returns undertaken as part of the IRS National Research Program (NRP). Depletion on domestic minerals (line 4) . Natural resource discoveries are not considered to be capital formation in the NIPAs; consequently, depletion—the charge for the using up of these resources —is not a charge against current production. In contrast, the IRS permits depletion to be charged as an expense. Through this adjustment, the SOI expense “depletion” is",

The adjustment is based on SOI tabulations of depletion. Adjustment to depreciate expendi tures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells (line 5) . Expenditures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells are treated as capital formation in the NIPAs. In contrast, the IRS permits some of these expenditures to be charged as current expense. Therefore, the SOI measures of depreciation, by industry, are adjusted to remove the expensed portion of the current year’s investment and to add a charge for the depreciation of the investments made in the current and in previous years. The capital formation of drilling and oil well casing is estimated fr om the American Petroleum Institute’s Joint Association Survey on Drilling Costs and BLS producer price indexes (PPIs). For oil well casing, the quantity is valued using the PPI for casing. For drilling, the quantity is valued using data in the Joint Survey. Expenditures for exploration are obtained from the Annual Survey of Oil and Gas . Expenditures for mine shafts are extrapolated from Census data. The value of the capital formation is depreciated over average service lives of 20 years by geometric depreciation. Bad debt expense (line 6 ). Bad debt expenses are not considered to be expenses associated with current production and thus should not be reflected as expenses in calculating NIPA profits. The adjustment removes these expenses, based on the bad -debt expense item in the SOI tabulations. Income received by fiduciaries (line 7) . Sole proprietors that act as fiduciaries (trustees, guardians, executors of trusts or estates) file IRS Form 1041 instead of Form 1040, and they are therefore excluded from SOI tabulations of proprietorships and partnerships. This adjustment adds their income, based on separately available SOI data for 1950, 1974, and 1985. For other years, gross profit s, depreciation, and other deductions are extrapolated separately using correspo nding items for nonfiduciary sole proprietorships as reported in the SOI tabulations. Income of tax -exempt cooperatives (line 8) . This adjustment is the sum of separate adjustmen ts for each type of “other” private business —specifically, rural electric cooperatives, rural telephone cooperatives, and farmers’ marketing cooperatives that are not included in the SOI tabulations because of their tax -exempt status . The adjustmen ts for rural electric and telephone cooperatives are bas ed on annual data from the USDA’s Rural Electrification Administration. The adjustment for farmers ’ marketing cooper atives estimates the patronage dividends earned by these cooperatives based on sales data and profit margins data provided by USDA’s Farmer Cooperative Service.",

In contrast, the IRS allows all uninsured disaster losses to be charged as current business expenses in “other deductions” on F orm 4684. Insurance payouts and receipts are also based on data from the Insurance Service Office, supplemented by government insurance fund transactions. Income receipts are distributed by industry using the above information on historic -cost depreciation . 16 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of major disasters (those in which either the associated property losses or the insurance payouts exceed 0.1 percent of GDP) that records them as “changes in the volume of assets” rather tha n as consumption of fixed capital; see Eugene P.

The featured measure of rental income of persons —rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment —is provided net of depreciation and the costs associated with providing property. As such, it can be viewed as a “profit - like” measure. In the summary NIPA tables, rental income of persons is a component of gross domestic income and of national income for the total economy, as well as measures of personal income and of private enterprise income. Definitions and Concepts Rental income of persons reflects the income that accrues from the provision of property (i.e., housing or other structures, equipment, intellectual property , or natural resources) owned by persons who are resident in the United States. 1 As shown in the sample of NIPA table 7.9 below, separate measures of rental income are provided for legal forms of organizations —for “other private business” and for “households and nonprofit institutions .” 2 The NIPAs classify persons that own property as either part of the household and NPISH sector or as part of the business sector . Specifically, individuals that rent property and are required to report rental and royalty income on the IRS individual income tax return , and tax-exempt cooperatives , are classified as part of “other private business ,” a subsector of the NIPA business sector .3 Individuals that occupy the homes that they own are treated as unincorporated businesses and are classified in the household and institutions sector . Because both types of property owners 1 Persons resident in the United States are those who are physically located in the United States and who have resided, or expect to reside, in this country for 1 year or more. For more information on residence, see “Definitions and Concepts” in Chapter 8: Net Exports of Goods and Services . 2 For more information on legal forms, see C hapter 2 : Fundamental Concepts . 3 Rental and royalty income are reported on IRS Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, a section of the individual income tax return. “Other private business” also includes entities that are not required to file but would be so required if they met size or income criteria.",
  "341": "CHAPTER 12: RENTAL INCOME OF PERSONS 12-2 reflect individuals or households , their rental and royalty incomes are included in the NIPA measure of rental income of persons (and therefore, as a component of personal income) .4 The NIPAs also provide measures of income from the rental of property owned by persons who are classified as proprietors or partnerships ( included in proprietors’ income ), by corporations ( in corporate profits) , and by governments (as part of government rents and royalties ). As noted in “ Chapter 2 : Fundamental Concepts ,” the NIPA production boundary for households is limited to the housing services provided by homeowners to themselves (“owner -occupied housing”) and the production of domestic services (e.g., market cleaning services). Thus, the rental income of households is limited to the services of owner -occupied housing. The provision of nonresidential properties, of rights to intellectual and natural resources, and of permanent -site housing services to tenants more closely resembles business activity; as such, it is recorded as production and income of other private business or of nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISH ). Measures of nonmarket household production, such as housework and childcare, are excluded from the NIPA s. 5 The incomes associated with the production by households of other market goods and services are recorded as proprietors’ income.6 Separate measures of rental income are provided by type of property and by type of occupant . Specifically, for other private business, separate measures are prepared for rental income from farm and nonfarm tenant -occupied permanent -site housing, from nonresidential properties (structures, equipment, and the real estate investments of private pension plans), and from the rights to intellectual property and natural resources (recorded as royalties). For households and NPISH, measures are prepared for rental income from nonfarm owner -occupied permanent -site dwellings , from mobile dwellings, from farm owner -occupied housing, and from tenant -occupied housing owned by NPISH. By convention, all rental income of persons from tenant -occupied permanent site housing is recorded as other private business or as NPISH, as noted above; also by convention, rental income from tenant -occupied mobile homes owned by persons is recorded as proprietors’ income. Table 12.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, rental income of persons. 4 The NIPAs a lso provide measures of the income and outlays of the households and institutions sector that exclude the income of “other private business,” and, as part of the 2003 comprehensive revision of the NIPAs, BEA began providing separate estimates of household and of NPISH income and outlays; see Cha rles Ian Mead, Clinton P. McCully, a nd Marshall B. Reinsdorf, “ Income and Outlays of Households and of Nonprofit Institutions Serving Households, ” S urvey of Current Business volume 83 (April 2003): 13-17. Additionally, the NIPAs provide measures of saving and investment of households and institutions sector that exclude “other private business.” 5 BEA has prepared alternative measures of household output that include the value of nonmarket household production; see Benjamin Bridgman, “ Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts ,” S urvey , volume 96 (February 2016): 1 -5. 6 Before 2003, the services of owner -occupied housing were a lso classified a s output of the business sector. As part of the 2003 comprehensive revision of the NIPAs, owner -occupied housing was reclassified to the households a nd institutions sector to reflec t the fact that the housing in this case is produced by households for their own use and is not sold on the market.",

The measure of rental income of persons includes income from nonresidential structures and from royalties, so it is not an exclusive measure of the income generated by housing services. T able 7.9 also includes a measure of “rental income with capital consumption adjustment” that excludes royalty income and is therefore more conceptually aligned with the provision of tangible property ; however , it includes income from the provision of structures and equipment , as well as housi ng. Neither is rental income of persons a comprehensive measure of the income generated by housing, as housing services are also provided by governments , by corporations, and by sole proprietorships and partnerships . Given the importance of housing to the health of the economy, the NIPAs also provide measures that reflect the production and income of an alternative “housing” sector, of which the households and institutions sector is only a part; these measures reflect the output associated with hous ing—and only housing — provided by all owners .7 Measures of f inal expenditures for housing services that are consistent with the output of the housing sector are reflected in BEA’s estimates of personal consumption expenditures . The inclusion in rental income of persons of income from tenant -occupied permanent -site housing, from nonresidential properties, and from rights to intellectual property or natural resource s is straightforward; as explained in chapter 2 , the income approach measures GDP —or gross domestic income (GDI) —as the sum of the income 7 Measures for the housing sector are discussed in Ma ye rhauser , Nicole a nd Marshall Reinsdorf, “ Housing Services in the National Economic Accounts ,” September 2007.",

The inclusion of income from owner -occupied housing (both permanent -site and mobile homes) in rental income of persons warrants further explanation. As not ed in chapter 2 , purchase s of newly c onstructe d housing are treate d as private fixed inve stment rather than as consumption expe nditu res in the NIPAs, and the stock of housing is treated a s fixed assets. The housing stock provide s a flow of housi ng servi ces th at are c onsum ed by persons who re nt their housing and by persons who own the housing they occupy (ref erred to a s “owner-occupiers ”). In the NIPAs, owner -occupiers are treated a s owni ng unincorpo rated e nterprises that provide housing services to themselves in the form of the rental value of their dw ellings.8 Thus, personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) for housing services in cludes both the monetary re nts paid by tenants and an imput ed rental value for owner-occ upied dw ellings (measure d as the in come the homeowner could ha ve received if the house had bee n rented to a tenant), and rental income of persons includes the monetary income earned by landlords and an imputed rental income earned by owner -occupiers . This trea tment is d esigned to make PCE, GDP, and the incomes associated with them invariant to wh ether the house is rented by a la ndlord to a tena nt or is liv ed in by the homeowner. The imputation also increases the international comparability of the NIPAs because rates of home ownership differ significantly from country to country; by including both tenant -occupied and owner -occupied housing services in output and income measures, comparisons are not affected by these differences. It is also worth noting that a s a component of income, depreciation —a cost incurred in production —is reflected in the measures of rental income, as shown in table 12.1 above. M uch of the source data underlying BEA’s measures of depreciation are based on tax -accounting information, so the source data must be adjusted to reflect consistent economic -accounting measures that are valued at current -replacement cost. The capital consumption adjustment ( CCAdj) is a two -part adjustment that (1) converts depreciation measures that are based on a mixture of service lives and depreciation patterns specified in the tax code to measures that are based on uniform service lives and empirically b ased depreciation patterns; and (2) converts the measures to a current -cost basis by removing from rental income the gain or loss that arises from valuing the depreciation of fixed assets using prices from earlier periods (i.e. prices at the time the asset was acquired) . 9 8This treatment is consistent with that of the in ternation al System of Na tional A ccoun ts 2008 (SNA 2008): “Households th at own the dwe llings they occupy are formally tr eated as owners of unincor porated enterprises that prod uce ho using serv ices consum ed by those same ho useholds.” Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008 : 6.117. 9 For information on the derivation of the CCAdj, see Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States , 1925 –97, September 2003, available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov .",

Additionally, it is a component of national income and, as a component of net operating surplus , it is reflected in gross domestic income (GDI) in the Domestic Income and Product Account (account 1).

H ousing -related expen ses are deducted because they are considered intermediate inputs to the production of rental services and as such, are already reflected in the rent charged for the service. In contrast, subsidies are added because it is assumed that owners reduce the rents they charge by the value of any property-related subsidies they receive. Measures of PCE for the services provided by tenant -occupied housing are based on data on rent paid by tenants and data on the number of tenant -occupied units, both from the American Community Survey’s (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). 12 For measures of PCE for the services provided by owner -occupied housing, estimates of rent per unit are derived using the rental equivalence approach, adjusted to include an “owner premium,” based on the same ACS data. The estimates of PCE for housing services are described in greater detail in “ Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures .” Nonfarm tenant -occupied permanent site housing For nonfarm tenant -occupied permanent site housing, the ACS data on rental value as well as the data described below from other sources on expenses and subsidies cover all owners —that is, corporations, proprietors, NPISH, and individuals . Total rental income is split between the personal and business sector s based on data from the Census Bureau’s Census of Housing Residential Finance Survey (RFS) on the percentage of rental receipts that are received by businesses. The personal sector is then further split between individuals (classified as other private business) and NPISH based on RFS data on the percentage of permanent -site rental units that each sub sector provide s. Finally, business sector rental income is then split between corporations and 11 Black Knight Financial Services was formerly Lender Processing Services Applied Analytics. 12 BEA uses “1 -year” ACS data; that is, data that are collected over 12 months of a calendar year. 1 -year data are collected for areas with populations of 65,000 or more.

For tenant -occupied housing, the current surplus of state and local housing enterprises and the following subsidies are added. 13 Subsidies are added to either tenant - or owner -occupied housing based on the nature of the subsidy. For tenant -occupied housing, the following subsidies are added: • Section 8: This program provides rental assistance payments to landlords on behalf of low-income tenants. Estimates are provided by type of landlord (nonprofit, private, and state and local enterprises). • Section 236: Under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Rental Housing Assistance Program) the federal government subsidizes the monthly mortgage payment that a qualified owner of a rental or cooperative project is required to make. This subsidy reduces rents for lower income tenants • Rural housing service (RHS): Under the Rental Assistance Program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s RHS provides assistance to tenants through the Rural Rental Housing or Farm Labor Housing projects. • Other housing subsidies: Includes rental assistance and affordable housing program s provided by other public enterprises . Nonfarm owner -occupied permanent site housing For nonfarm owner -occupied permanent site housing, the PCE measure of the rental value is imputed using a stratified rental equivalent approach that regresses tenant rents, from which utilities have been excluded, on characteristics of tenant -occupied units report ed in the ACS .

For owner -occupied housing, the following subsidies are added: • Section 235: The Housing and Urban Recovery Act of 1983 program subsidizes the interest payments of eligible homeowners for 10 years. • Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA ): FEMA provides disaster - related subsidy payments for temporary housing, repairs, mortgage and rental assistance, etc. • Road Home Grant s: The Road Home program was a Federal grant to the states of Louisiana and Mississippi to aid persons displaced by Hurricane s Katrina and Rita .

The rental value is adjusted to exclude expenses for maintenance and repairs, property taxes, mortgage interest, and property insurance. Estimates of these expenses are based on data from the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS). For tenant -occupied farm housing, the rental value is also adjust ed for the capital consumption allowances of operator and non-operator landlords, based on IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) data. For owner -occupied housing, the r ental value is adjusted to remove an estimate of consumption of fixed capital , based on data from BEA’s Fixed Assets Accounts. No subsidies are added to either owner - or tenant -occupied measures . The NIPAs do not record separate estimates of permanent site and mobile farm housing because source data on expenses are insufficient to support such a split. When a housing unit is identified in the ACS as a mobile unit and a farm unit, BEA allocates that unit as a farm unit . Tenant -occupied housing owned by NPISH For tenant -occupied housing owned by nonprofit institutions , the measure of the rental value is derived and allocated between individuals and NPISH as described above. Deducted expenses include property taxes, mortgage interest, depreciation, property insurance, maintenance and repairs, and administrative expenses ; no subsidies are added. Nonfarm nonresidential properties For nonfarm nonresidential properties , rental income is estimated by multiplying BEA’s measures of the nonfarm nonresidential capital stock of structures and equipment owned by persons by an estimated rate of return on these assets. The rate of return on these assets is estimated by dividing the profits of corporate real estate operators and lessors of buildings, based on SOI data, by the value of their depreciable assets , also based on SOI data . The re ntal income of private employee pension funds imputed to persons is added to the to tal measure, based on data from the Federal Reserve Board . Royalty income For royalty income from intellectual property and from the rights to natural resources , rental income is equal to the net royalties received by individuals, by fiduciaries, and by nonprofit organizations less the expense of bonus payments for drilling rights for what are ultimately found to be “dry holes.” Data are primarily from the IRS SOI program.

The estimates of corporate profits are an integral part of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “ Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts ”). Corporate profits is one of the most closely watched U.S. economic indicators. Profitability provides a summary measure of corporate financial health and thus serves as an essential indicator of economic performance. Profits are a source of retained earnings, providing much of the funding for capital investment s that raise productive capacity. The estimates of p rofits and of related measures may also be used to evaluate the effects on corporations of changes in policy or in economic conditions. Profits are also frequently used in measuring the rate of return on investment and the relationship between earnings and equity valuation. For example, the estimates of corporate profits before and after tax , along with estimates of corporate net value added, are used in preparing BEA’s annual measures of aggregate rates of returns for domestic nonfinancial corporations. 1 BEA’s featured measure of corporate profits —profits from current production— provides a comprehensive and consistent economic measure of the income earned by all U.S. corporations. As such, it is unaffected by changes in tax laws , and it is adjusted for nonreported and misreported income. It excludes dividend income, capital gains and losses, and other financial flows and adjustments, such as deduction for “bad debt.” Thus, the NIPA measure of profits is a particularly useful analytical measure of the health of the corporate sector. For example, in contrast to other popular measure s of corporate 1 See Sarah Osborne and Bonnie A.

In addition, BEA prepares associated measures of payments arising from corporate profits , including taxes and dividends . Taxes on corporate income consists of taxes on income paid to government and to the rest of the world. Corporate taxes are an important source of funding for federal and for state and local government operations. Net dividend payments consists of payments to shareholders by U.S. corporations. Corporate dividends paid to shareholders measures investment returns to them in the form of curre nt income , including dividends paid to persons as a component of the NIPA measure of personal income . Definitions and Concepts Corporate profits measures the income, before deducting income taxes, of organizations treat ed as corporations in the NIPAs. T hese organizations consist of all entities required to file federal corporate tax returns, including mutual financial institutions and cooperatives subject to federal income tax; nonprofit organizations that primarily serve business; Federal Reserve banks; and federally sponsored credit agencies. Reflecting the concepts of national economic accounting, income in the NIPAs is defined as that aris ing from current production. T his income is measured as receipts less expenses as defined in federal tax law , but with several important differences .2 Table 13 .1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, corporate profits. Table 13 .1—Content of Corporate Profits Category of transaction Comments Corporate profits before tax Includes all U.S. corporations , including private corporations and S corporations. Includes other organizations that do not file federal corporate tax returns —such as certain mutual financial institutions and cooperatives, nonprofits that primarily serve business, Federal Reserve banks, and federally sponsored credit agencies. Receipts exclude gains, net of losses, from the sale of property . Receipts exclude dividends received. Expenses include distributions to s hareholders of regulated investment companies that represent interest income, which are classified as interest payments in the NIPAs. 2 The NIPA measures of corporate profits are closely rela ted to the measures for corporations in the Sy stem of National Accounts (SNA). However, the SNA definition has a broader definition of the corporate sector that includes most federal government and state and local government enterprises and private entities such a s limited lia bility pa rtnerships a nd n onprofit institutions that are primarily engaged in market production.

Inventory valuation adjustment Inventory withdraw als are valued at current cost. Capital consumption adjustment Depreciation is valued at current cost. Most businesses report profits on both a financial -accounting basis and a tax- accounting basis. 3 Both financial accounting and tax accounting calculate profits as the difference between receipts and expenses ; however, they differ in the definition s of some receipts and expenses , in the timing of when the receipts and expenses are recorded , and in the purposes for wh ich the information is prepared. Financial -accounting measures, which reflect “generally accepted accounting principles,” underlie the reports to stockholders , to lenders, and to government regulatory agencies; tax -accounting measures underlie corporate income tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has tabulate d an information return (the M -3) that reconciles various items (such as employee stock options) reported on financial reports with the same items reported on most corporate tax returns , beginning with 2005. The a nnual and quarterly financial reports prepared by individual companies provide the basis for another widely followed set of indicator s of corporate profits —the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 measures of reported earnings, operating earnings, and earnings per share, which reflect the aggregate earnings of the 500 corporations that compose the S&P stock index. 4 When available, BEA uses data collected on a tax-accounting basis as the primary source of information on corporate profits . These data are based on well -specified , consistent accounting de finitions that, in general, more closely parallel NIPA concepts and definitions. For example, i n financial accounting, corporations sometimes record the value of extraordinary losses before they actually incur the expenses associated with the losses. Financial accounting also allow s some flexibility in the way definitions are applied by corporations —for example, in the selection of asset service lives and in the valuation of liabilities. In addition, tax-accounting tabulations are comprehensive, covering all incorporated businesses —both publicly traded and privately held—and all industries , while financial-accounting tabulations cover a subset of the corporate unive rse. However, financial -accounting information is more timely than tax -return data, so it is used by BEA to derive the estimates for the most recent year and for the current quarters. Neither set of accounting data is entirely suitable for implementing the NIPA concept of profits from current production. Consequently, BEA’s procedure for 3 For a general discussion of the NIPA accounting framework and of the underlying accounting principles, see the section “Accounting Framework,” in C hapter 2 .

PBT—sometimes referred to as “book profits” —reflect s corporate income regardless of any redistribution of income made through taxes. The PBT estimates are primarily based on tax-return information provided by the IRS in Statistics of Income: Corporation Income Tax Returns , which is then adjusted to conform to BEA coverage and definitions .6 PBT is distributed to government as taxes on corporate income and to shareholders as dividends or is retained as undistributed profits . The estimates of PBT are prior to the IVA and CCAdj (which are discussed in the following two paragraphs) , so PBT reflect s the charges used in business tax accounting for inventory withdrawals and for depreciation. As prices change, businesses that value inventory withdrawals at original acquisition (historical) costs may realize inventory profits or losses. In the NIPAs, these gains or losses that result from holding goods in inventory are not considered income from current production and thus are re moved from business income . The IVA converts the business -accounting valuation of withdrawals from inventory, which is based on a mixture of historical and current costs , to a current-cost basis by removing the capital - gain-like or the capital -loss -like element that results from valuing these withdrawals at prices of earlier periods.7 Depreciation measured on a business -accounting basis must be adjusted to reflect consistent economic -accounting measures that are valued at current -replacement cost . The CCAdj is a two -part adjustment that (1) converts valuation s of depreciation that are based on a mixture of service lives and depreciation patterns specified in the tax code to valuation s that are based on uniform service lives and empirically based depreciation patterns ; and (2) l ike the IVA, converts the measures of depreciation to a curr ent-cost basis by removing from profits the capital -gain -like or capital-loss -like element that arises from valuing the depreciation of fixed assets at the prices of earlier periods.8 5 See the section “Overview of Source Data and Estimating Procedures.” In addition, for an in -depth discussion of estimation issues regarding corporate profits, see Dylan G.

As part of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, businesses were permitted to depreciate a “bonus” amount during the first year, over and above that allowed under traditional ta x a ccounting rules .

Profits from current production (PBT with IVA and CCAdj) was not affected by the acts, because it does not depend on the depreciation -accounting practices used for federal income tax purposes; instead, this measure of profits is based on an estimate of the value of fixed capital actually used up in the production process. However, because the acts reduced tax liability, profits from current production on an after -tax basis was adjusted by the net effect of the tax acts. Because the acts affect tax depreciat ion, the CCAdj was also adjusted by the same amount.

These earnings include capital gains and other income excluded from PBT. The taxes are measured on an accrual basis, net of applicable tax credits. Profits after tax with IVA and CCAdj is equal to corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj less taxes on corporate income . It provides an after -tax measure of profits from current production. Net d ividends consists of p ayments in cash or other assets, excluding the corporation's own stock, made by corporations located in the United States and abroad to stockholders who are U.S. residents. The payments are netted against dividends received by U.S. corporations, thereby providing a measure of the dividends paid by U.S. corporations to other sectors . Undistributed corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj is equal to corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj less taxes on corporate income and less net dividends. It measures corporate saving from profits. Net cash flow with IVA is equal to undistributed corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj plus consumption of corporate fixed capital less capital transfers paid (net). It is a profits -related measure of internal funds available for investment. Consumption of fixed capital (CFC) is the economic charge for the use of fixed capital. It is defined as the decline in the value of the stock of assets due to wear and tear, obsolescence, aging, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event. 10 Capital transfers paid (net) is the net measure of unrequited transfer s associated with the acquisition or disposal of assets between the corporat e sector and other sectors. Corporate profits with IVA is de fined in the same way as corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj, except corporate profits with IVA reflects the depreciation-accounting practices used for f ederal income tax returns. Profits by industry is shown on this basis because estimates of the CCAdj by industry are not available. 10 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of major disasters (those in which either the associated property losses or the insur ance payouts exceed 0.1 percent of GDP) that records them as “changes in the volume of assets” rather than as CFC; see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, “ Preview of the 2009 Comprehensive Revision of the NIPAs: Changes in Definitions and Presentations ,” S urvey 89 (March 2009): 11 –15.",
  "361": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-7 Profits after tax without IVA and CCAdj is equal to PBT less taxes on corporate income . It consists of net dividends and undistributed corporate profits. This measure is often used in comparisons with the S&P measures of reported earning s. Undistributed corporate profits without IVA and CCAdj is equal to PBT less taxes on corporate income and less net dividends. It measures corporate saving from book profits. In addition, BEA prepares estimates of g ross corporate value added (see NIPA table 1.14), which is defined as the total value of all goods and services produced by the corporate sector (gross output) less the value of those goods and services that are used up in production (total intermediate inputs). For a discussion of the derivation of gross corporate value added and of related measures, see the appendix to this chapter. Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2 , the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy. In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj appears in the Private Enterprise Account (account 2), and undistributed corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj appears in the Domestic Capital Account (account 6). Taxes on corporate income appears in the Private Enterprise Account, the Government Receipts and Expenditures Account (account 4), and the Foreign Transactions Current Account (account 5). Corporate dividends appears in the Private Enterprise Income Accoun t, the Personal Income and Outlay Account (account 3), the Government Receipts and Expenditures Account, and the Foreign Transactions Current Account. The NIPAs include a substantial number of tables that present aggregate and detailed current -dollar estimates of corporate profits. In most of the NIPA tables, the totals are shown on a national basis. In tables showing industry detail, profits on a national basis are shown as the total of profits for domestic industries and for the “rest- of- the-world ” industry.

  "363": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-9 Overview of Source D ata and Estimating P rocedures As described earlier in the handbook, the NIPA estimates, including those for corporate profits, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “ Chapter 3: Principal Source Data ”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “ Chapter 4: Estimating Methods ”). As d iscussed earlier in the chapter , corporate profits from current production is derived as the sum of PBT, IVA, and CCAdj. The primary source for the PBT estimates is tax return information provided by the IRS in Statistics of Income: Corporation Income Tax Returns (Corporation Returns) ; BEA makes a series of adjustments to these data to conform them to NIPA coverage and definitions. BEA then adjusts the PBT estimate with the IVA and the CCAdj in order to derive an estimate of income earned from curre nt production that is consistent with NIPA concepts. This section describes the sources and methods used for estimating PBT and for estimating the distributions of PBT.11 Payments from PBT to government as taxes on corporate income and to shareholders in other sectors as dividends are estimated independently and are discussed below . Undistributed profits —that is, profits that are retained by corporations —are derived by subtracting taxes on corporate income and net dividends from PBT . Table 13 .A at the end of the main text summarizes the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the annual estimates and the current quarterly estimates of corporate profits for the industry categories shown in NIPA table 6.16. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Annual (except most -recent -year) estimates For all but the most recent year, t he annual estimates of PBT, taxes on corporate income , and net dividends for domestic industries are based primarily on annual tabulations of corporate income tax returns. The annual estimates of PBT and of net dividends for the rest of the world are from BEA's international transactions accounts (ITAs). 12 The tabulations of corporate income tax returns are prepared by the IRS and published in Statistics of Income: Corporat ion Income Tax Retur ns. The tabulations are based on a stratified sample of unaudited tax returns that currently includes all active corporations with more than $50 million of assets (with certain exceptions) and smaller firms on a probability basis. The information on the returns is edited by the IRS in the course of preparing the tabulations. The tabulations provide the basis for estimate s for the 11 For information on the derivation of the estimates of the IVA and the CCAdj, see “ Chapter 7: Change in Priva te Inventories ,” and see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, 1925 –97, S eptember 2003. 12 For a detailed description of the ITA’s, see “ U.S. International Transactions Accounts: Concepts and Methods ” (June 201 4) on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov .",

The IRS totals are the starting point for preparing the NIPA estimates. The preliminary and final IRS tabulations become available about 2 years and 3 years, respectively, after the year to which they refer , and this timing determines the incorporation of these data into the NIPA estimates. F or exa mple, in the September 2023 annual update of the NIPAs, th e final IRS tabulations for 2020 became the primary source for the estimates of corporate profits for 2020 (replacing the preliminary tabulations as the source), and the prel iminary IRS tabulations for 2021 became the primary source for the profits estimates for 2021 .

This net number accounts for dividend payments made to persons and to government (also shown on line 18 of NIPA table 7.10, which shows a breakdown of dividends paid and received by sector ). Dividends payments made to government (federal plus state and local governments on line 13 of table 7.10) are subtracted from total net corporate dividend payments to arrive at personal dividend income (line 21 of table 7.10). 14 Most -recent -year estimates Profits before tax For PBT, the estimates for the most recent year are prepared by extrapolating the estimates for the preceding year (for a general description of the extrapolation method, see “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in chapter 4 ). The extrapolations are carried out separately for each of about 75 industries using indicators that are based on a variety of source data. Two of the principal sources are the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Financial Report and BEA tabulations of samples of shareholder reports. The Quarterly Financial Report is the source for the indicators for the following industries: mining; manufacturing; wholesale trad e; retail trade; information; and professional, scientific, and technical services, except legal services . The indicators are based on tabulations of corporate income statements collected and published quarterly by the Census Bureau. They are derived by taking the Quarterly Financial Report measure “income (loss) before taxes” and subtracting the following items where possible: (1) dividend income, (2) nonrecurring items, including gain (loss) on sale of assets, restructu ring costs, and asset write -downs, and (3) net income (loss) of foreign branc hes and equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries, net of foreign taxes. Aggregated shareholder reports are the source for the indicators for all of the components of the following industries: construction; administrative and waste management services; educational services; health care and social assistance; arts, 14 For more infor mation on the derivation of dividend payments received by state and local governments, see the NIPA methodology paper MP -5 “Government Transactions ” (September 2005) on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov .",

In addition, they are the source for the indicators for most of the components of the following industries: utilities; transportation and warehousing; finance and insurance; and real estate and rental and leasing. The indicators are based on income from samples of shareholder reports , including data drawn from S&P’s Compustat database for all public U.S. corporations that have reported data for the current and the prior year . For each ind ustry, t he indicator used is “ pre-tax income” l ess “special charges” (unusual or nonrecurring items reported by the company before the deduction of taxes ). In addition to the removal of special charges, BEA judgmentally removes certain other non-operating charges, such as unrealized mark -to-market gains or losses, asset write -downs, and other valuation gains or losses. For some financial industries, the indicators are based on i nformation from reports filed with various government regulatory agencies , such as Call Reports with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, and from the annual reports of the various financial institutions . The indicators for the few remaining domestic industries are based on judgmental trends . For the rest -of-the-world industry, the es timates are from the ITAs . (For more information, s ee table 13.A.) Taxes on corporate income For the two tax series for which the annual estimates a re not based on IRS tabulations of corporate income tax returns —nonresident taxes and state and local taxes on corporate income —the estimates for the most recent year are prepared using the same methods as those used for the preceding year (see the technical note to this chapter , table 13.8, lines 2 4–26). For federal taxes, the estimates of the carryback refunds adjustment for the most recent year are prepared using the same methods as those for the preceding annual estimates, while the audit tax adjustment is a judgmental estimate (see the technical note, table 13. 8, line 2 3). For federal taxes (net of tax credits), the estimates for each industry are prepared by extrapolation, using indicators that are based on the same sources as those used for the PBT estimates. The industry esti mates are summed and then forced to match a control total by absorbing proportionate shares of the difference. The control total is primarily based on data on tax collections from the Monthly Treasury Statement , separated by liability year using information from the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis. Net dividends Estimates for the most recent year are ex trapolated , using indicators that are based on the same sources as those used for the PBT estimates. For dividends received by U.S. corporations from abroad , the IRS -based estimates are extrapolated using dividends paid by foreign corporations from the ITAs. F or regulated investment companies , the estimates are extrapolated based on data from the Investment Company Institute. For real estate investment trusts, the estimates are extrapolated based on industry source data. For",
  "369": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-15 Federal Reserve banks and for federally sponsored credit agencies , the estimates for dividends are prepared using the same methods as those used for the preceding year (see the technical note, table 13. 9, line 3 4). As with the preceding annual estimates, total net corporate dividends less dividend payments made to government yields personal dividend income. Current quarterly estimates The seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates of PBT are derived by extrapolating the most -recent -year estimates (for an explanation of this method, see “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in Chapter 4 ). The industry indicators used for the quarterly extrapolations are generally based on the same (seasonally adjusted) source data as those used for the most -recent -year estimates (see table 13 .A). Not seasonally adjusted estimates of PBT are derived using the same method s as the seasonally adjusted estimates , using not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators . For nonresident taxes , the current quarterly estimates are prepared using the same methods as those used for the annual estimates. Seasonally adjusted (SA) estimates of other federal taxes are estim ated by industry by dividing the SA PBT estimates by the implicit quarterly tax rate from the most recent year and judgmentally adjusting for outliers . This technique is based on the assumption that tax laws have not changed much from the previous year; if tax laws change appreciably, further judgmental adjustments are made . For state and local taxes, the estimates are based on tax collections data and on a timing factor that, in turn, is a function of the quarter -to-quarter change in NIPA profits before tax and the average tax rate.15 Not seasonally adjusted ( NSA ) tax rates are calculated in the same manner as SA tax rates; the SA PBT estimates are divided by the implicit quarterly tax rate from the most recent year and judgmentally adjusting for outliers. Quarterly estimates of gross flows of domestic corporat e dividends paid and received are not prepared. Therefore, the current quarterly estimate of net national dividends is derived as a residual in the calculation of the current quarter ly personal dividends. For the first, second, and third quarters of the calendar year , preliminary quarterly estimates of PBT, taxes on corporate income, and net dividends are released approximately 55 days after the end of the quarter (along with the “second” estimates of GDP) , and revised quarterly estimates are released approximately 85 days after the end of the quarter (along with the “third” e stimates of GDP) . In general, the preliminary quarterly estimates are based on less complete information than the revised estimates. For 15 See Eugene P. Seskin and Alyssa E. Holdren, “ Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts ,” S urvey 92 (August 2012): 25.",

For the fourth quarter of the year , preliminary estimates are not prepared, and the only current estimate s for that quarter are released approximately 85 days after the end of the quarter. This delay occurs because the fiscal year for most corporations ends in the fourth quarter , and additional time is needed to complete the more comprehensive end-of-year reports. As part of the calculation of dividends received by persons, an estimate of net national dividends paid by c orporations becomes available on the same schedule as the estimates of GDP , approximately 25 days , 55 days, and 85 days after the end of the quarter. In a reversal of the accounting identities used for preparing the annual estimates of dividends , personal dividends received are estimated first. Monthly estimates of SA personal dividends are prepared using as an indicator the seasonally adjusted dividends paid based on a Compustat sample. The monthly estimates are averaged to derive quarterly estimates of personal dividends received , which are then added to dividends received by government to derive net national dividends. Rest-of-the-world dividends (net) are subtracted to derive net domestic dividends, which are then split into financial and nonfinancial sectors using data from the Compustat sample. NSA personal dividends are derived using an NSA indicator based on a Compustat sample.",

Adjustment for misreporting on income tax returns (line 2) . This adjustment is primarily based on IRS audit data. Unlike the tax-return source data, which reflects a specific tax year, the audit data is based on the year the audit is resolved and collected. For the audit data, it is assumed there is a 1 -year lag between the referenced tax year and the year in",
  "378": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-24 which the majority of audits for that tax year are resolved. Thus, for the misreporting adjustment, the most recent audit data is used to derive an adjustment for the preceding tax year. For example, in the 2023 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, 2021 was the most recent tax year, and 2020 was the year for which the available audit data were used to prepare the misreporting adjustment. For subsequent years, the adjustment was judgmentally extrapolated. The IRS audit consists of three steps. First, the IRS audits a small sampling of corporations and recommends how much, if any, additional tax liability is owed. Next, the corporations can appeal those recommendations. Finally, a resolution between the corporation and the IRS is reached , and the corporation pays the IRS. The methodology for the misreporting adjustment is to capture only the amount of tax actually collected (see the section “Taxes on Corporate Income”), raise it to a universe total, and then convert it from a tax-liability measure to a profits measure. The IRS publishes data on the recommended additional tax liability owed, stratified by asset size, but the amount actually collected is provided only for the total. Therefore, a ratio of additional collected tax to recommended additional tax is developed and applied to the recommended amounts on an asset -by-size basis to derive a universal total for additional tax liability. Finally, this tax -liability estimate is converted to a profits estimate using the statutory tax rate. The above methodology applies to corporations that are paying taxes on positive net income. For companies that report deficits and pay no taxes, the percentage of corporate deficits reported by IRS (based on historical research) is added to the above estim ate of profits misreporting to arrive at the corporate misreporting adjustment.

Income of Federal Reserve banks and other federally sponsored credit agencies (lines 5 and 6) . Federal Reserve banks, Federal Home Loan Banks, and the Farm Credit System are included in the corporate sector of the NIPAs. Because these institutions do not file tax returns, their income and expenses are not included in Corporation Income Tax Returns. Through this adjustment, the profits of these institutions are included in PBT, based on information on net income from their annual reports. Other organizations not filing corporation income tax returns (line 7). Personal injury trusts, the Universal Service Administration Company (USAC), and nonprofit organizations serving business that are exempt from income tax under section 501(c) are included in the NIPA corporate sector. Personal injury trusts are business -established independent legal entities that administer payments for damages resulting from product liability claims. These payments are considered transfer payments from business to persons at the time the funds are disbursed. Receipts and payments data are collected from individual trust fund reports. USAC earnings are measured as receipts less outlays, from the Monthly Treasury Statement. The earnings (surplus) of agricultural organizations, business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and organizations to finance crop operations are based on IRS tabulations of information returns filed by tax-exempt organizations.",
  "381": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-27 The earnings of credit unions are treated as PBT in the NIPAs; however, they are not reflected in Corporation Income Tax Returns, because income of these institutions is not taxed. The adjustment consists of net income less dividends to shareholders and interest refunds as tabulated by the National Credit Union Administration for state - chartered and federally chartered credit unions. Depletion on domestic minerals (line 8) . Natural resource discoveries are not considered to be capital formation in the NIPAs; consequently, depletion—the charge for the using up of these resources —is not a charge against current production. In contrast, the IRS permits depletion to be charged as an expense. Through this adjustment, the Corporation Income Tax Returns expense “depletion” is reduced by the domestic depletion claimed on tax returns, thereby increasing profits. The adjustment is calculated as the difference between depletion from Corporation Income Tax Returns and an estimate of foreign depletion based on special IRS studies. (The effect of foreign depletion is removed in line 17.) Adjustment to depreciate expenditures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells (line 9) . Expenditures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells are treated as capital formation in the NIPAs. In contrast, the IRS permits some of these expenditures to be charged as current expense. Therefore, “other deductions” in Corporation Income Tax Returns are adjusted to remove the expensed portion of the current year’s investment and to add depreciation charges on investment made in the current and in previous years. Estimates of oil and natural gas drilling expenses are obtained from data on drilling footage and on prices from the American Petroleum Institute’s Joint Association Survey on Drilling Costs , BLS producer price indexes (PPIs), and until 1995, the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Oil and Gas. Beginning with 2006, prices are based on the Census Bureau’s Annual Capital Expenditures Survey an d on PPIs . Estimates of expenses for the construction of mine shafts (for minerals other than petroleum and natural gas) are based on the quinquennial economic census and on capital expenditures from the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey. Depreciation charges for investment in mining exploration, shafts, and wells are estimated using a perpetual inventory calculation in which the investment is depreciated over time. The adjustment is prepared as an aggregate for all business and is allocated by legal form of organization and by industry, based on IRS tax-return data. State and local taxes on corporate income (line 10). PBT is measured before deduction of income taxes. Because state and local income taxes are expense items on the federal tax return, they must be added to Corporation Income Tax Returns “total receipts less deductions.” The estimate of taxes is based on state and local government receipts compiled by the Census Bureau in Quarterly Summary of State and Local Tax Revenue . The industry distribution of these taxes is based on data from Corporation Income Tax Returns for federal income tax liability.",
  "382": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-28 Interest payments of regulated investment companies (line 11). Interest payments of regulated investment companies are not reflected as expenses in the Corporation Income Tax Returns measure of total deductions. The adjustment adds interest payments as an expense in calculating NIPA profits and is equal to the interest received less the interest share of total deductions, based on Corporation Income Tax Returns tabulations for regulated investment companies. Bad debt expense (line 12). Bad debt expenses are not considered to be expenses associated with current production and thus should not be reflected as expenses in calculating NIPA profits. The adjustment removes these expenses, based on the bad -debt expense item in the Corporation Income Tax Returns . Adjustment to depreciate expenditures for intellectual property products (line 13) . Expenditures for intellectual property products are treated as capital formation in the NIPAs. 16 In contrast, the IRS permits some of these expenditures to be charged as current expense.17 Therefore, “other deductions” in Corporation Income Tax Returns are adjusted to remove the expensed portion of the current year’s investment and to add depreciation charges on investment made in the current and in previous years.

For more information on the sources and methods for intellectual property products, see the technical note at the end of “ Chapter 6: Private Fixed Investment .” Disaster adjustments (net) (line 1 4). In the NIPAs, t he loss of capital as a result of a catastrophic disaster and the insurance payouts that result from them do not affect income associated with current production. The adjustment consists of (1) the net of the value of losses recorded as depreciation (a current business expense) and (2) the insurance payouts made by insurance companies as a charge against profits less the income received by the claim holders.18 Depreciation estimates are based on data on insured damages at current cost, broken down by type, from the Insurance Service Office. The amount is adjusted for uninsured damages, distributed by industry according to regional impact using data from the Cens us Bureau’s County Business Patterns , and converted to historic -cost depreciation using various service lives and price indexes. In contrast, the IRS allows all uninsured disaster losses to be charged as current business expense s in “other deductions” on Form 4684. Insurance payouts and receipts are also based on data from the Insurance Service Office, supplemented by government insurance fund transactions. Income receipts are distributed by industry using the above information on historic -cost depreciation. Gains, net of losses, f rom sale of property (line15). Gains (net of losses) from sales of fixed assets and securities are not considered to be income from current production. Corporation Income Tax Returns total receipts less total deductions are adjusted to remove these gains and losses. The adjustment consists of the following items from Corporation Income Tax Returns : (1) the excess of net short -term capital gain o ver net long-term capital loss, from Schedule D, (2) the excess of net long -term capital g ain over short -term capital loss (except for regulated investment companies), from schedule D, and (3) the net gain or loss from Form 4797 with two modifications for cases in which the gain or loss reflects current production. The first modification relates to income from the sale of timber, coal, iron ore, livestock, and unharvested crops. This income is treated as a gain or a loss for tax purposes but should be included in NIPA profits because it reflects current production. Therefore, an estimate of such gains or losses, based on data from Corporation Income 18 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of major disasters (those in which either the associated property losses or the insur ance payouts exceed 0.1 percent of GDP) that records them as “changes in the volume of assets” rather than as consumption of fixed capital; see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, “ Preview of the 2009 Comprehensive Revision of the NIPAs: Changes in Definitions and Presentations ,” Survey 8 9 (March 2009): 11 –15. I I",
  "384": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-30 Tax Returns and from BEA special studies, is subtracted from the Corporation Income Tax Returns net gains. The second modification relates to “normal” accidental damage to fixed business capital.19 In Corporation Income Tax Returns, the net gains items include the excess of insurance payments for accidental damage over the historical -cost book value of the damaged property. In the NIPAs, this amount is not considered a capital gain: the insurance payment is an expense of current production for insurance carriers, and the historical cost of the damaged property is treated as depreciation. Thus, the Corporation Income Tax Returns net gains items are modified to exclude the amount of excess, which is estimated as the difference between the insurance payments, based on data on insurance losses from Best’s Aggregates and Averages: Property -Casualty , and BEA estimates of normal accidental damage to fixed capital other than repairable damage (see NIPA table 7.13, line 5). Dividends received from domestic corporations (line 16). These dividends are not part of corporate income from current production. However, receipts by corporations of dividends paid to them by other domestic corporations are included in total receipts less deductions in Corporation Income Tax Returns. This adjustment, based on information from Corporation Income Tax Returns , removes these dividends. Income on equities in foreign corporations and branches (to U.S. corporations ) (line 1 7). This adjustment places total receipts less total deductions from Corporation Income Tax Returns on a domestic basis by removing the income earned abroad by U.S. corporations that is included in this total. The adjustment is estimated as the sum of (1) dividends received from abroad, from Corporation Income Tax Returns; (2) other foreign -source income reported in support of claims for foreign tax credits, from special I RS tabulations of Form 1118; and (3) income earned by U.S. corporations from operations in U.S. commonwealths and territories, from special IRS tabulations . Costs of trading or issuing corporate securities (line 18). The costs of trading and issuing corporate securities are treated as expenses of the current period in calculating NIPA profits. In contrast, in tax accounting, these costs are usually deferred, so an adjustment is needed. This adjustment can be divided into two parts: commissions (both explicit and implicit) and flotation costs (the costs of issuing debt or equity securities). The securities trading costs adjustment converts tax data, which treat expenses for brokers’ commissions as a reduction in future capital gains income, to a current -period expense for the purchase of brokers’ services. Most corporate capital gains are excl uded by subtracting net gains reported on IRS tax forms using IRS source data associated with Schedule D of IRS Form 1120. However, this adjustment does not account for the capital gains on own-account trading of securities brokers and dealers, which reflect the imputed financial service charge paid by corporations to domestic securities dealers who do not 19 The NIPA treatment of the loss of capital as a result of a catastrophic disaster was covered in the above discussion of line 14.",
  "385": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-31 charge an explicit commission. Thus, a separate adjustment is needed to exclude these types of capital gains. The securities trading costs adjustment treats commissions to brokers, commercial banks, and savings institutions from securities trading as an expense in the current period rather than as a reduction in future capital gains income. This adjustment applies to both explicit commissions and commissions indirectly charged through markups or “spreads” between the cost of acquiring a security and its sales price. The estimates of trading costs are based on product -line data on gains from brokering and dealing equities, debt securities, and derivatives from the Census Bureau’s 2012 Economic Census. These data are used to estimate total indirect commissions received, which are treated as expenses of the corporations purchasing securities from broker -dealers, and are allocated by type of buyer using Federal Reserve Board flow of funds data on securities holdings. Estimates of direct commissions are derived similarly. For commercial banks and for savings institutions, capital gains are estimated as the sum of trading account gains and fees and of securities gains from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data, less indirect commissions. For security brokers and deal ers, estimates of capital gains through 2006 are based on data on gains from dealing and trading accounts from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey, less indirect commissions; thereafter, they are extrapolated based on company financial reports. 20 For flotation costs, the adjustment is made to treat the m as an expense in the current period rather than as amortized costs. The estimate is based on tabulations of new offerings of corporate securities and of associated expenses by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC). The allocation by industry is based on the SEC tabulations and on data on holdings of long -term mortgages and capital stocks from Corporation Income Tax Returns . Excess of employer expenses over actual employer contributions for defined benefit employee pension plans (line19 ). Corporate income tax return data on employer expenses for defined benefit plans are adjusted to reflect the difference between cash -based and accrual -based compensation and the interest costs of any underfunded or overfunded actuarial liabilities.21 The adjustment is based on data from the Employee Benefit Security Administration, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, the Social Security Administration, and the American Council of Life Insurance. Income received from equities in foreign corporations and branches by all U.S. residents, net of corresponding payments (line 20). As noted previously, the adjustments to total receipts less total deductions thus far produce estimates of PBT for domestic industries 20 For additional information on securities trading adjustments, see Clinton P. McCully and Steven Payson, “Preview of the 2009 Comprehensive Revision: Statistical Changes ,” Survey 89 (May 2009): 13 –14. 21 As pa rt of the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, the treatment of pension pla ns wa s improved by recording the transactions of defined benefit pension plans on an accrual basis and by recognizing the costs of unfunded lia bilities.

The audit adjustment is unique among tax adjustments in that the source data are not available to adjust the preliminary IRS tabulations; for that estimate, the adjustment is made judgmentally. In the NIPAs, tax refunds resulting from net operating losses are viewed as reducing tax liability in the year of the loss. IRS permits corporations with such losses to carry the loss back to claim a refund for taxes paid in preceding years and to carry forward the amount of the loss to offset profits in future years. BEA obtains data on carryback refunds from IRS tabulations of applications for carryback refunds. The adjustment is allocated by industry on the basis of deficits reported in Corporation Income Tax Returns. No adjustment is required for carry-forward losses, because the lower tax payments are reflected in Corporation Income Tax Returns. As indicated in table 13.5, several of the posttabulation adjustments to profits also have a tax impact. State and local taxes on cor porate income (line 2 4). In the NIPAs, taxes on corporate income includes federal, state, and local taxes.

Corporate gross value added is defined as the total value of all goods and services produced by the corporate sector (gross output) less the value of the goods and services that are used up in production (total intermediate inputs). It is derived as the sum of consumption of fixed capital, compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, and net operating surplus.

For the nonfinancial sector, esti mates of gross value added in “real” terms —that is, adjusted for inflation —are also prepared.

This index is not published, although separate indexes for goods and for structures are shown in NIPA table 1.2.4. Incorporation of this index occurs with each release of the profits estimates . Estimates of real net value added are then derived as t he difference between real gross value added and real consumption of fixed capital.

NET INTEREST (December 2023) Definitions and Concepts Recording in the NIPAs Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods Annual estimates Current quarterly estimates Table 14A —Summary of Methodology for Net Interest Appendix: Miscellaneous Payments The NIPA measure of “net interest” for the domestic economy r eflects the aggregate interest paid, less the aggregate interest received, by business and by the rest of the world; conversely, it reflects the net income earned by government and persons for providing certain financial resources to the production process . As the measure includes only the interest that is charged for the provision of financial resources used in, or associated with, production, it is a useful indicator of the return to that type of financial investment . Interest is a type of property income; specifically, interest is a measure of the income “r eceivable by the owners of certain kinds of financial assets, namely: deposits, debt securities, loans and (possibly) other accounts receivable for putting the financial asset at the disposal of another institutional unit.”1 As such, interest income is not directly generated in the production process, and it is therefore excluded from the NIPA measure of gross domestic income.2 However, net receipts of interest (that is, receipts less payments) are included in the NIPA measures of corporate profits and of proprietors’ income, both of which are components of gross domestic income. To offset the se receipts , the NIPAs include net interest payments (payments less receipts) as a component of gross domestic income to ensure that this measure appropriately reflect s only those incomes that are directly generated in production.3 In the NIPA measures of gross domestic income and of national income, net interest is c onsolidated with “miscellaneous payments” —a measure of the rent and royalty payments that accrue to owners of land or subsoil assets in return for leas ing the rights to these assets for 1 System of National Accounts, 2008 (SNA). See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co -operation a nd Development, United Na tions, a nd the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008 : 7.113 . 2 Interest is adjusted to capture t he value of services provided by financial institutions furnished without payment , which are directly generated by the production process . As such, measures of these services are imputed and recorded in the NIPA measures of output and income, as described later in this chapter and in the technical note to Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures . 3 Interest flows are off set entirely in the computation of gross domestic income. However, national income includes net interest received from the rest of the world, which is consistent with the treatment of interest in the System of National Accounts, 2008 (SNA).",

Definitions and Concepts The NIPAs provide measures of monetary and imputed interest transactions. The inclusion of m onetary interest transactions in th e NIPAs is straightforward; as explained in Chapter 2 : Fundamental Concepts , the income approach measure of GDP, or gross domestic income (GDI), is the sum of the income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services. The inclusion of “imputed” interest transactions warrant s further explanation. M easures are imputed to reflect (1) the implicit income received by the financial services provider for the provision of services where explicit fees are not charged ; these imputations allow the NIPAs to separately identify the value of financial services furnished without payment by commercial banks, savings i nstitutions, credit unions, regulated investment companies , and by property and casualty insurance companies ; (2) the under- or overfunding of defined benefit pension plans; and (3) certain transactions that are re-routed in the NIPAs so that they are attr ibuted to the ultimate recipient and/or provider of the service rather than to intermediaries.4 This last category includes the allocation to policyholders of the interest earned on their behalf by life insurance carriers and by property and casualty insurance carriers, and the allocation to households of interest earned by pension funds. Financial services furnished without payment . Businesses often provide financial services related to investment activities that are not matched by explicit service charges , such as check processing, disbursing or transferring funds, bookkeeping, protecting deposited funds, and intermediation. Instead, payment for these services may be implicit, such as when banks pay depositors lower rates of interest or charge borrowers higher rates of interest than what they would otherwise charge, or when insurance companies charge lower premiums than they would in the absence of the interest earned on technical reserves . The NIPAs record impute d measures of these service charges to ensure that the accounts accurately reflect the final demand, output, and value added related to these services and to keep GDP invariant to whether banking services involve an explicit or implicit charge. These measures are recorded as both personal consumption expenditures and government consumption expenditures for financial services furnished without payment. 5 A corresponding amount is recorded as interest income. For depositor services, the amount is recorded as imputed interest paid by depository institutions to depositors. For borrower services, the amount is recorded as negative imputed interest received by depository institutions from borrowers. 4 For a detailed accounting of the imputations included in GDP, see NIPA table 7.12, “Imputations in the National Income and Product A ccounts ,” available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov . 5 See the technical note on “Financial services furnished without payment” in Chapter 5 : Personal Consumption Expenditures .",

Thus, a def ined ben efit pension plan may be, and often is, underfunded, implying that it doe s not ha ve su fficient f inancia l assets to meet its obligations . In other cases, the plan may be overfunded, implying that it has assets in excess of what are needed.

Additionally, interest payments and receipts are recorded as part of the income and outlays of each domestic sector; as such, they are recorded in the Private Enterprise Account (account 2), in th e Personal Income and Outlays Account (Account 3), and in the Government Receipts and Expenditures Account (Account 4); the interest flows between the nation and the rest of the wo rld appear in the Foreign Transactions Current Account (Account 5). The NIPAs include a substantial number of tables that present nominal, or “current- dollar,” estimates of net interest paid and the gross interest flows of business, persons, and government. The following is a list of the principal NIPA tables that present estimates of interest for the nation and for sectors.9 1.7.5 Relation of Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Product, Net National Product, National Income, and Personal Income 1.10 Gross Domestic Income by Type of Income 1.12 National Income by Type of Income 1.13 National Income by Sector, Legal Form of Organization, and Type of Income 1.14 Gross Value Added of Domestic Corporate Business in Current Dollars and Gross Val ue Added of Nonfinancial Domestic Corporate Business in Current and Chained Dollars 8 For a discussion of domestic and national measures, see “Geographic Coverage,” in Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts . 9The NIPAs also present annual, quarterly, and monthly estimates of “Personal interest income” in NIPA table group 2 as a component of personal income. Annual and quarterly estimates of personal interest income are available in NIPA table 2.1. Personal Income and Its Disposition, and monthly estimates are available in NIPA table 2.6. Personal Income and Its Disposition, Monthly. Personal interest income is distinguished between households and nonprofit institutions in NIPA table 2.9.

Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier, the NIPA e stimates, including those for interest payments and receipts , are prepared using a wi de var iety of sourc e data (see “ Chapter 3: Pr incipal Sourc e Data ”) and using e stima ting methods tha t adjust the sourc e data to the re quired NIP A con cepts and tha t fill in ga ps in coverage and t iming (see “ Chapter 4: E stima ting Methods ”). For monetary interest flows, t he estimates are based primarily on statistical reports from the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) Statistics of Income (SOI) program , the Department of Agriculture, and the Federal Reserve Boar d (FRB) , and on administrative and regulatory agency reports from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) . For imputed interest flows, the estimates are based primarily on data from the IRS’ SOI program , the FRB , the FDIC, and BEA’s International Transactions Accounts (ITAs), as well as trade association data from the National Credit Union Association, the Credit Union National Assoc iation , and the American Council of Life Insurers. Table 14.A following the main tex t summar izes the sourc e data and e stima ting methods that are used to prepare the current-dollar annual e stimate s for measures of monetary and imputed interest paid and received as shown in NIPA table 7.11. For most measures, the estimating methods are the same for all years; the table notes those cases where the method differs for the most recent year . As quarterly estimates are available only for selected aggregates, they are described below but are not included in the table.",
  "402": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-7 Annual estimates The NIPAs provide separate measures of the monetary and imputed interest paid and received for each NIPA sector, although the sectors differ according to the type of measure because of the various institutional arrangements associated with different assets and liabi lities, and because of the mixed sectoring scheme employed by the NIPAs.10 Specifically, for monetary interest payments, measures are provided for domestic corporate business (financial and nonfinancial), unincorporated business (sole proprietorships and partnerships and “other private business”), for households and institutions, for government (including government enterprises), and for the rest of the world. For monetary interest receipts, measures are provided for domestic corporate business (financial and nonfinancial), for financial sole proprietorships and partnerships, for other private business, for persons, for government, and for the rest of the world. 11 “Other private business” is comprised of certain individuals that rent property and of tax-exem pt cooperatives; persons is comprised of households, nonprofit institutions serving households, and owners of nonfinancial noncorporate businesses. Measures of imputed interest payments are also provided for selected sectors, but these measures are furth er distinguished by the type of service, as follows: (1) For imputed interest paid by providers of depositor, insurance, and pension services , measures are provided for domestic financial and nonfinancial corporations, for government, and for the rest of the world. (2) For imputed interest received by users of depositor, insurance, and pension services, measures are provided for domestic business (financial and nonfinancial corporations, sole proprietorships and partnerships, and other private business), for households and institutions, for government, and for the rest of the world. (3) For imputed interest paid by users of borrower services , measures are provided for domestic financial and nonfinancial corporate business, for sole proprietorships and partnerships, for other private business, for households and nonprofit institutions, for government, and for the rest of the world. (4) For (negative) imputed interest received by providers of borrower services, measures are provided for domestic financial corporations (i.e., banks, credit agencies, and investment companies) and for the rest of the world . The benchmark and nonbenchmark annual measures of interest paid and received are derived using the same methodologies. 10 For more information on NIPA sectors, see Chapter 2 ; see also Stephanie H. McCulla, Karin E. Moses, and Brent R. Moulton, “ The National Income and Product Accounts and the System of National Accounts 2008: Comparison and Research Plans ,” Survey 95 (June 2015): 1 -17. 11 The mixed sectoring scheme employed in the NIPAs classifies “other private business” —that is, individuals that rent property and are required to report rental and royalty income on the IRS individual income tax return (or those that would be so required i f they met size or income criteria), and tax -exempt cooperatives —as part of the business sector for production measures, and as part of the personal sector for income measures, with the exception of production- related interest transactions, such as interes t payments on mortgage loans, which are classified in the business sector.",
  "403": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-8 Monetary interest For payments and receipts of monetary interest, annual measures are based on unique source data for each sector or, in some cases, subsector. For monetary interest paid and received by domestic corporate business and by sole proprietorships and partnerships , annual estimates except the most recent year are primarily based on data from the IRS SOI program .12 For the most recent year, SOI data are not available, and estimates are extrapolated using various indicators. For monetary interest payments, extrapolations prim arily use Compustat data on interest expense by industry and FDIC Call Report tabulations of interest expense for financial corporations. For monetary interest receipts, the extrapolations are based on FDIC Call Report data on interest income. Estimates of monetary interest payments and receipts for Federal Reserve banks, a component of corporate financial business, are based on data from FRB annual reports. While t he SOI data are largely consistent with the concepts and definitions underlying the NIPA estimates of interest payments and receipts , BEA makes several adjustment s to account for differences in coverage and definitions. A reconciliation of the IRS and NIPA estimates of interest payments and receipts is published annually in NIPA table 7.17, a reproduction of which is shown for a single year in table 14.2 below.

  "406": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-11 Imputed Interest For imputed interest paid and received , annual estimates are based on source data for the type of service for which the measure is imputed—that is, for depositor, insurance, and pension services and for borrower services—and for the type of institution. Only financial corporations and the rest of the world pay imputed interest for depositor and insurance services ; imputed interest payments for pension services are paid by financial and nonfinancial corporations, and by government. For financial corporations , the derivation of e stimates of imputed interest paid for depositor and insurance services differs according to the specific type of institution. Specifically, for banks and credit agencies, measures are derived using the “reference rate approach,” in which the value of the services that are provided without explicit payment is measured as equal to the difference between the monetary interest paid to depositors or charged to borrowers and a “reference rate” that reflects the opportunity cost of borrowing or lending funds . 17 For regulated investment companies, measures are derived as the sum of commissions and the imputed interest received from commercial banks on deposits the companies hold on behalf of its investors. For life insurance carriers, the NIPAs derive measures of the interest earned on the carriers’ technical reserves based on trade source data. For property and casualty insurance companies, the NIPAs measure the value of the services that are provided without explicit payments as equal to the expected investment income earned on technical reserves. 18 For the rest of the world , the measures of imputed interest paid for depositor and insurance services are derived using the reference rate approach as described above. The total measures of imputed interest paid for depositor and insurance services are allocated to the receiving sectors (that is, financial and nonfinancial corporations, partnerships and proprietorships, other private business, households and institutions, government, and the rest of the world) based on their share of each type of asset held, based on data from the FRB ’s Financial Accounts of the United S tates (FAUS) and on ITA data. For pension services , measures of interest are imputed to reflect the under - or overfunding of defined benefit employee pension plans for domestic financial and nonfinancial 17 The reference rate approach and the NIPA treatment and measurement of the output of depository institutions is described in Dennis J. Fixler, Marshall B. Reinsdorf, and George M. Smith, “ Measuring the Services of Commercial Banks in the NIPAs ,” Sur vey of Current Business 83 (September 2003): 33- 44, and in Mou lton and Seskin, 2003.

  "407": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-12 corporations and government . Specifically, the NIPAs derive measures of the liability reflected by under- or overfunding plans using an accrual accounting approach, in which the under- or overfunding is measured as equal to the difference between the actuarial ly determined present value of the plans’ liabilities (or “normal cost”) and the actual financial assets held by the plans. 19 Only domestic and rest of the world financial institutions provide borrower services without explicit payment ; the associated value of imputed interest is recorded as negative interest receipts for these sectors . Measures of the total imputation for banks, credit agencies, and investment companies are derived using the reference rate approach ; the resulting negative totals are allocated to the borrowing sectors (domestic financial and nonfinancial institutions, sole proprietorships and partnerships, other private business, households and institutions, government, and the rest of the world) based on the share of each type of liability held by each sector from the FRB FAUS data and the ITAs. 20 Current quarterly estimates As with the annual measures, the quarterly measures of interest paid and received in the NIPAs are the sum of monetary interest and imputed interest. However, quarterly measures are provided only for select net interest aggregates and sectors, because the source data required for more detailed components are not consistently available on a quarterly basis. Specifically, the NIPAs provide quarterly measures of aggregate “net interest and miscellaneous payments , domestic industries ” and “net interest and miscellaneous payments” for corporate business and for nonfinancial corporate business, but separate quarterly measures of interest payments and interest recei pts are provided only for government and for persons. 21 For “net interest and miscellaneous payments, domestic industries” in GDI , quarterly measures of net interest are derived as the residual of personal interest receipts less personal interest payments less net interest paid by government less net interest paid by the rest of the world. This derivation is based on the axiom that the total amount of interest paid by all sectors must equal the total interest received by all sectors, as follows: B p + P p + G p + F p = B r + P r + G r + F r 19 The NIPA trea tment and measurement of the over - or underfunding of defined benefit pension plans is described in Marshall B. Reinsdorf and David G.

  "418": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-23 Appendix: Miscellaneous Payments Miscellaneous payments is a measure of the rent and royalty payments that accrue to federal and to state and local government owners of land or subsoil assets (that is, mineral deposits located within the earth or on the earth’s surface) in return for leasing the rights to these assets for various productive uses.25 Specifically, this includes federal government receipts from leasing federally -owned lands for mining or energy production and state and local receipts from allowing temporary possession of government-owned buildings, land, or other fixed properties; these include revenues such as grazing fees, timberland leases, and natural resource exploration and production. Bonus payments, which are typically one-time payments made to hold the land during the bidding process, are excluded because they are unrelated to production; the NIPAs record them as part of nonproduced assets.26 In the United States, rent—which the NIPAs treat as a distinct and separate transaction from rental payments made for housing—is paid during the initial, non- productive phase of a lease and reflects the “holding cost” of the lease. Royalties are paid during actual production and vary based on the market value of minerals extracted and sold during a set period of time. 27 Table 14.A.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, miscellaneous payments in the NIPAs. 25 Miscellaneous payments do not include rents and royalties that accrue to private landowners for the provision of rights to physical assets such as mineral rights as well as privately -owned intellectual property rights; these measures are included in rental income of persons, proprietors’ income, and corporate profits. 26 The NIPA treatment of rents and royalties is consistent with the recommendations of the SNA. The SNA groups rent and royalty payments together as “rents”; see paragraph 7.110 in Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008 , available at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/SNA2008.asp. 27 An additional category of royalties refers to payments made to use or reproduce copyrighted or patented resources; these transactions are treated as sales of services, which are unrelated to natural resources and are not included in the NIPA measure of miscellaneous payments.",

Excludes oil bonus payments for drilling rights, which are classified as nonproduced assets.

Excludes oil bonus pay ments for drilling rights, which are classified as nonproduced assets.

  "421": "APPENDIX : SUMMARY NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS APPENDIX: SUMMARY NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS (Updated: May 2019) This appendix presents the definitions of the line items that make up the seven summary national income and product accounts (NIPAs). These accounts simplify both the transactors and transactions in the U.S. economy. The transactors are shown in three distinct groups, or sectors — persons, businesses, and government; a fourth sector for the rest of the world is added to cover transactions between U.S. r esidents and foreign residents. The seven summary accounts show the contribution of each sector to the output of the economy, their income and outlays, and their saving and investment. The summary NIPAs, which are shown on the following three pages of this appendix, constitute a double -entry accounting system in which each of the entries in a summary account appears again in that account or in one of the other summary accounts. The numbers in parentheses indicate these “counter -entries.” In some cases, an entry may be equal to another entry in the summary accounts. For example, supplements to wages and salaries appears in account 1, line 5 and in account 3, line 14. In other cases, an entry may be equal to a combination of other entries (or parts of other entries). For example, for private enterprise interest payments (account 2, line 2), the counter -entry includes parts of private enterprise interest receipts (account 2, line 21, of personal interest income (account 3, line 20), of government interest receipts (account 4, line 20), and of interest payments to the rest of the world (account 5, line 13). For a description of the accounting principles that underlie the summary NIPAs, see the section “Accounting Framework” in “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts.” For a more in -depth discussion, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, An Introduction to National Economic Accounting, Methodology Paper No. 1, September 2007.",

  "426": "5 APPENDIX : SUMMARY NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS Account 1. Domestic Income and Product Account This account shows the production of all sectors of the U.S. economy. The right (product) side of the account shows GDP as the sum of final expenditures by consumers, private business, government, and foreigners, and the left (i ncome) side of the account shows GDP as the sum of the incomes earned and the costs incurred in generating that production. Line 1 –1: Compensation of employees, paid The total remuneration, both monetary and in kind, payable by employers to employees in return for their work during the period. It consists of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance). In the NIPAs, compensation is presented on an accrual basis —that is, it reflects compensation liabilities incurred by the employer in a given period regardless of when the compensation is actually received by the employee. Line 1 –2: Wages and salaries The total remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; voluntary employee contributions to certain deferred compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans; employee gains from nonqualified stock options; receipts -in-kind; and miscellaneous compensation of employees, such as judicial fees to jurors and to witnesses.

In contrast, payments associated with the acquisition or disposal of assets are classified as capital transfers. Line 1 –8: Net operating surplus A profits -like measure of the surplus accruing from the processes of production before deduction any explicit or implicit interest charges, rent, or other property incomes payable on financial assets, land, or other natural resources required to carry out production. It is equal to gross operating surplus less consumption of fixed capital. Line 1 –9: Private enterprises (2 –19) Consists of private business, the activities of households and institutions that are included within the production boundary of the N IPAs (primarily the services of owner -occupied housing), and, for the purpose of estimating monetary and imputed interest payments and receipts, nonprofit institutions serving households. Line 1 –10: Current surplus of government enterprises (4–28) Current operating revenue and subsidies received from other levels of government less current expenses, such as intermediate purchases and employee compensation. In this calculation, no deduction is made for net interest paid, because the interest payments of government enterprises are not separately identified from other government interest in the government receipts and expenditures account. Line 1 –11: Consumption of fixed capital (6–14) The NIPA measure of economic depreciation —that is, the decline in the value of the stock of fixed assets due to physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event. For nonprofit institutions serving households and for general government, Consumption of fixed capital serves as a measure of the value of the capital services of the fixed assets owned and used by these entities. Line 1 –12: Gross domestic income The sum of incomes earned, and costs incurred in the production of gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic income (GDI) is equal to the sum of compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, net operating surplus, and consumption of fixed capital. In theory GDI should equal GDP, but in practice, they differ because their components are esti mated using largely independent and less -than- perfect source data; this difference is termed the “statistical discrepancy.”",
  "428": "7 APPENDIX : SUMMARY NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS Line 1 –13: Statistical discrepancy (6–20) The difference between the NIPA measure of production that is derived as the sum of final expenditures (gross domestic product) and its counterpart measure that is derived as the sum of the costs incurred and the incomes earned in production (gross domestic income). The statistical discrepancy arises from the independent estimation of the two measures using different source data and methods. It is recorded in the NIPAs as an “income” component that reconciles the income side with the product side of the account s. Line 1 –14: GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BEA’s featured measure of U.S. production. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of the final goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States.

GDP is also equal to the sum of value added by industry across all industries. Line 1 –15: Personal consumption expenditures (3 –3) The primary measure of consumer spending in the U.S. economy. It is the NIPA final - demand component that measures the value of the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, “persons” who reside in the United States.

It consists of two components: nonresidential fi xed investment and residential fixed investment. Line 1 –22: Nonresidential Component of gross private fixed investment that measures investment by businesses and nonprofit institutions in nonresidential structures, equipment, and intellectual property products. Line 1 –23: Structures Component of nonresidential fixed investment that measures new construction (including own- account investment), improvements to existing structures, expenditures on new nonresidential mobile structures, brokers’ com missions on sale of structures, mineral exploration, and net purchases of used structures by private business and by nonprofit institutions from government agencies.

Inventories may be in the form of goods ready for sale (finished goods), of goods undergoing production (work in proc ess), or of goods acquired for use in the production process (materials and supplies). Change in private inventories differs from the change in the book value of inventories reported by most businesses, which are valued using a variety of accounting methods and thus may include holding gains or losses resulting from price changes. Line 1 –28: Net exports of goods and services The net foreign component of final demand in the NIPAs. It is calculated as exports of goods and services less imports of goods and se rvices.

The t erms r elate t o the concepts, class ifications, and accounting framework of the NIPAs, the general sources and methods used to prepare the NIPA e stimates, a nd the line items t hat m a ke up the seve n summar y NIPAs. For the most pa rt, the NIPA de f initions are c onsistent wit h those used in general e conomic accounting, suc h as the System of N ational A ccounts (SNA); w here a ppropriate, explanations of differences are provided. T his gl ossary is intende d to be a livi ng reference that will be updated a nd expanded to ref l ect changes and ad ditions as they are i ncorporated in t o the NIPA H andbook. Term Definition Accrual accounting Method of accounting that records the sale of goods or assets when ownership is transferred, the sale of services when they are provided, the generation of output when goods or services are produced, the consumption of intermediate goods and services when they are used, and the compensation of employees when it is earned. Administrative data Data tabulated as a byproduct of administering progra ms of the federal government and of state and local governments —such as processing corporate tax returns, regulating public utilities, issuing building permits, and handling unemployment insurance claims. “Advance” quarterly estimates First vintage of the three sets of current quarterly estimates of GDP and its components, the advance estimates are released near the end of the month that follows the end of the reference quarter. For most GDP components, the advance estimates are based on source data that cover 2 or 3 months of the quarter and that are subject to revision. Annual industry accounts Part of BEA’s industry economic accounts, these accounts consist of the annual input -output accounts and the GDP -by-industry accounts. Annual input-output (I-O) accounts Part of BEA’s annual industry accounts, these accounts consist of a set of I-O tables —make table, use table, and several supplementary tables — that provide a time series of consistent statistics on the flow of goods and services that make up the production process of industries and to final users in the economy. For each year, beginning with 1998, the accounts show how industries interact as they provide inputs to, and use outputs from, each other to produce GDP. These accounts, which are consistent with the GDP -by-industry accounts, incorporate less comprehensive source data than those used for the benchmark I-O accounts.",
  "448": "2 Annual NIPA revisions See Annual NIPA updates . Annual NIPA updates Periodic updates of the NIPA estimates usually carried out each summer. These updates incorporate newly available source data that are based on more extensive annual surveys, on annual data from other sources, and on revisions to the monthly a nd quarterly source data that were not available for incorporation into the NIPA current quarterly estimates. The revisions cover at a minimum the 3 most recent calendar years, but BEA may extend the revision period to allow for the incorporation of improvements in methodologies when warranted. Also referred to as “ annual revisions. ” Annual rates Quarterly and monthly NIPA estimates in current and chained dollars are presented at annual rates, which show the value that would be registered if the level of activity measured for a quarter or for a month were maintained for a full year. Annual rates are used so that periods of different lengths —for example, quarters and years —may be easily compared. These annual rates are determined simply by multiplying the estimated level of activity by 4 (for quarterly data) or by 12 (for monthly data). Annual rates of change Percent changes in quarterly NIPA estimates are expressed at annual rates, which show the value that would be registered if the pace of activity measured for a quarter were maintained for a full year. Calculating these changes requires a variant of the compound interest formula. Asset Entity that functions as a store of value and over which ownership rights are enforced and from which economic benefits may be derived by the owner. Asset boundary In the U.S. national economic accounts, the asset boundary includes transactions involving financial assets and produced and nonproduced nonfinancial assets. Averag e of GDP and GDI A supplemental measure of economic activity that equally weights the measures of GDP and GDI. Balance of payments See “International transactions accounts.” Balance on current t Net measure of transactions between the United States and the rest of the world in goods, services, income, and current transfers. Balance sheet A statement showing the value of assets owned and the financial claims (or liabilities) incurred by an economic unit or sector at a specified point in time. Base period In the derivation of quantity or price estimates, the period from which the weights are drawn for a fixed -weighted index.",
  "449": "3 Benchmark input-output (I-O) accounts Part of BEA’s industry economic accounts, these accounts consist of a set of I-O tables —make table, use table, and several supplementary tables — that provide detailed statistics on the flow of goods and services from each industry to other industries and to final users in the economy. The se accounts, which are prepared at about 5-year intervals, are based on comprehensive data from the Census Bureau’s quinquennial Economic Census. The benchmark I -O accounts are used to determine the structure and level of GDP for the comprehensive revisions of the NIPAs. Benchmark NIPA revisions See “Comprehensive NIPA updates .” Best change A procedure for incorporating newly available source data so that the estimates provide accurate measures of change across time periods, though the levels of the estimates may not be consistent with the newer source data. Because, in general, the levels of economic time series are only revised as part of an annual or a comprehensive update , newly available source data are frequently incorporated into the current quarterly estimates on a best -change basis in order to avoid discontinuit ies in the time series. In general, the best -change procedure is carried out by applying quarter -to-quarter growth rates from the source data to a previously published estimat e for an earlier period. Best level A procedure for incorporating newly available source data so that the estimated levels of the time series are consistent with those of the source data. Incorporation of source data on a best -level basis is generally car ried out as part of an annual or a comprehensive update . Business current transfer payments (net) Net payments by private businesses to persons, to government, and to the rest of the world for which no current services are performed, such as donations by business to charitable organizations. Does not include “capital transfers.” Business sector Consists of private business (all corporate and noncorporate private entities organized for profit and certain other entities that are treated as businesses in the NIPAs) and of government enterprises (federal government enterprises and state and local government enterprises). See “Private business” and “Government enterprises.” Capital account In economic accounting, an account that shows how saving is used to acquire nonfinancial assets, such as fixed assets and inventories. Als o referred to as a “saving and investment account.” Capital consumption See “Consumption of fixed capital.”",
  "450": "4 Capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj) The adjustment used to convert measures of depreciation that are based on historical -cost accounting—such as the capital consumption allowances reported on tax returns —to NIPA measures of private consumption of fixed capital that are based on current cost with consistent service lives and with empirically based depreciation schedules. Capital consumption allowances (CCA) Consists largely of tax-return -based depreciation charges for corporations and for nonfarm proprietorships and partnerships and of historical-cost depreciation charges (calculated by BEA) for farm proprietorships and partnerships, rental income of persons, and nonprofit institutions. Capital formation See “Gross domestic fixed investment” and “Gross fixed investment.” Capital gains or losses Gains or losses that accrue during an accounting period to the owners of assets and liabilities as a result of changes in their prices. Also referred to as “holding gains or losses.” Capital services The services derived from assets that are used in production. It can be measured either as the rental price charged for the use of the asset, or in the absence of a rental market, as the sum of consumption of fixed capital and the value of the return to ca pital (for government and for nonprofit institutions, the value of the return to capital is assumed to be zero). Capital transfers Cash or in -kind transactions in which the ownership of an asset is transferred from one economic unit to another, in which c ash is transferred to enable the recipient to acquire another asset, or in which the funds realized by the disposal of another asset are transferred. Examples of capital transfers include capital grants made by the federal government to state and local government for construction of highways and estate or gift taxes. Cash accounting Method of accounting that records only cash payments and receipts and that records them at the time these payments or receipts occur. Catastrophic losses Unanticipated losses resulting from large scale, discrete, and recognizable events, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, that destroy assets. Such losses are not included in consumption of fixed capital but are instead classified as “other changes in the volume of assets” that are recorded as direct adjustments to the net capital stock and balance sheet.",
  "451": "5 Chained -dollar estimates Inflation -adjusted estimates that are prepared to supplement the chain - type quantity indexes. In general, the chained -dollar es timates are calculated by multiplying the current -dollar value of an aggregate or component for the reference year by its corresponding chain -type quantity index and then dividing by 100. These estimates are denominated in units of the dollars of the refer ence year. The chained - dollar estimates may be used to calculate growth rates (which will be identical to those calculated using the quantity indexes), but because these estimates are not additive for periods other than the reference year, they should not be used to calculate component shares of an aggregate or to calculate component contributions to the growth of an aggregate. Chain -type indexes Quantity and price indexes that are based on the linking (chaining) of indexes for consecutive periods to form time series. In the NIPAs, annual changes in the quantities and prices calculated using a Fisher index formula that incorporates weights from 2 adjacent years are used to construct the chain-type indexes. These indexes eliminate the substitution bias found in indexes with unchanging (or “fixed”) weights, and their movements are not affected by the choice of the reference period. Change in private inventories (CIPI) The component of gross private domestic investment that measures the change in the physical volume of inventories —additions less withdrawals —owned by private business, valued in average prices of the period. Inventories may be in the form of goods ready for sale (finished goods), of goods undergoing production (work in process), or of goods acquired for use in the production process (materials and supplies). CIPI differs from the change in the book value of inventories reported by most businesses, which are valued using a variety of account ing methods and thus may include holding gains or losses resulting from price changes. Command -basis gross domestic product An alternative measure of real GDP that provides information on the real purchasing power of the income generated by the production of goods and services. It reflects the impact of changes in the prices of traded goods and services as well as changes in production. Command - basis GDP is calculated by deflating both exports and imports by the price index for gross domestic purchases. Thus, it reflects the prices of purchased goods and services, while real GDP reflects the prices of produced goods and services. In the SNA, the term for this measure is “real gross domestic income.”",
  "452": "6 Commodity -f low method A method used by BEA to estimate various components of consumer spending, of investment in equipment and software, and of state and local government spending. The process begins with estimates of the domestic output or domestic sales or shipments of a commodity valued in producers’ prices. Then, estimates of the domestic supply of that commodity—the amount that is available for domestic consumption— are prepared by adding imports and by subtracting exports and inventory change. Next, the domestic supply of the commodity is allocated among domestic purchasers —that is, persons, business, and government. Finally, the estimates are converted to purchasers’ prices by adding transportation costs and trade margins. Compensation of employees The total remuneration, both monetary and in kind, payable by employers to employees in return for their work during the period. It consists of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance). In the NIPAs, compensation is presented on an accrual basis —that is, it reflects compensation liabilities incurred by the employer in a given period regardless of when the compensation is actually received by the employee. Comprehensive NIPA revisions See Comprehensive NIPA updates. Comprehensive NIPA updates Extensive updates best available source data, including the benchmark input-output accounts; they provide the opportunity to make definitional, statistical, and presentational changes to the NIPAs; and they may affect estimates extending back for many years. Also referred to as “benchmark revisions” or “comprehensive revisions.” Constant prices See “Laspeyres index” and “Chained -dollar estimates.” Consumer durable goods Commodities, such as motor vehicles, that are purchased by consumers and are used repeatedly or continuously over a prolonged period. In the NIPAs, purchases of consumer durables are treated as personal consumption expenditures rather than as investment, but they are included in BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts. Consumption of fixed capital (CFC) The NIPA measure of economic depreciation —that is, the decline in the value of the stock of fixed assets due to physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event. For nonprofit institutions serving households and for general government, CFC serves as a measure of the valu e of the capital services of the fixed assets owned and used by these entities.",
  "453": "7 Corporate business In classification by legal form of organization in the NIPAs, corporate business comprises all entities required to file federal corporate tax returns, IRS Form 1120 series. It also includes mutual financial institutions and cooperatives subject to federal income tax, private noninsured pension funds, nonprofit organizations that primarily serve business, Federal Reserve banks, and federally sponsored credit agencies. Command -basis gross national product (GNP) An alternative measure of real GNP that provides information on the real purchasing power of the income generated by the production of goods and services. It reflects the impact of changes in the prices of traded goods and services as well as changes in production. Command- basis GNP is calculated by deflating both “exports plus income receipts” and “imports plus income payments” by the price index for gross domestic purchases. Thus, it reflects the prices of purchased goods and services, while real GNP reflects the prices of produced goods and services. In the SNA, the term for this measure is “real gross national income.” Corporate profits with inventory va luation and capital consumption adjustments The net income, before taxes, from current production of entities that are treated as corporations in the NIPAs. For corporate businesses, it is defined as gross output less the following expenses: intermediate inputs, compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports (less subsidies), consumption of fixed capital, net interest and miscellaneous payments, and business current transfer payments. The estimates are based on receipts less expens es from corporate income tax returns, with adjustments to account for differences between federal tax law and NIPA concepts. Among these differences are the following: receipts exclude net capital gains and dividends received; expenses exclude bad debt, depletion, and state and local taxes on corporate income; inventory withdrawals are valued at current cost; and depreciation is on a consistent accounting basis and valued at current -replacement cost. Coverage adjustments Adjustments that are made to source data in order to account for NIPA definitions and concepts or for information that is not contained in the source data, either because the data were not collected or because the data were incomplete. Current -cost The valuing of an asset at the prices prevailing at the time the valuation is made. It incorporates the effects of both depreciation and the changes in the market prices of that type of asset. For example, the 2010 current - cost estimate for an asset is based on the price that would have been paid to acquire that asset in 2010, and the 2011 current -cost estimate for that asset is based on the price that would have been paid to acquire that asset in 2011.",
  "454": "8 Current -dollar estimates Estimates valued in the prices of the period when the transactions occurred —that is, at “market value.” Also referred to as “nominal estimates” or as “current -price estimates.” Current production Production that takes place during the current period —that is, during the period being measured. In measuring GDP, the final sales recorded for product -side components —such as personal consumption expenditures — in the current period may include goods that were produced in earlier periods, so the recording of changes in inventories provides a means to allocate production to the period in which it actually occurred. Current quarterly estimates Three sets of NIPA estimates that provide initial pictures of U.S. economic activity for a given quarter. These estimates are released successively in the 3 months following the end of the quarter: the “advance” estimates are released near the end of the first month, the “second” estimates are released near the end of the second month, and the “third” estimates are released near the end of the third month. Current surplus of government enterprises Current operating revenue and subsidies received from other levels of government less current expenses, such as intermediate purchases and employee compensation. In this calculation, no deduction is made for net interest paid, because the interest payments of government enterprises are not separately identified from other government interest in the government receipts and expenditures account. Current transfer payments (net) Cash or in -kind transactions in which one of the parties receives nothing directly in return, such as unemployment benefits paid by government to persons. Excludes payments that are associated with the acquisition or disposal of fixed assets , such as estate taxes or gift taxes (see “capital transfers”). Defense Portion of federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment that covers the military activities of the U.S. Department of Defense and the defense -related activities of other government agencies, such as certain atomic energy activities of the U.S. Department of Energy. Deflation method The most common method for preparing inflation -adjusted, or “quantity,” estimates for most detailed NIPA c omponents. In this method, the quantity estimate for a NIPA component is derived by dividing its current -dollar value by the value of an appropriate price index—that is, one whose definition and coverage most closely match those of the series being deflated. Depletion The reduction in the value of deposits of subsoil assets (such as minerals and oil) as a result of the physical removal and using up of the assets, and the reduction in the value of uncultivated biological assets (such as natural forests and fish stocks in the open seas) beyond sustainable levels of extraction. In the NIPAs, natural resource discoveries are not considered to be capital formation, so reductions in these resources are not treated as charges against current production.",
  "455": "9 Depreciation The decline in the value of fixed assets due to physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, or accidental damage. In business accounting, depreciation is generally measured at historical cost, whereas in the NIPAs, the economic measure of depreciation, “consumption of fixed capital,” is measured at current cost. Direct investment Investment in which a resident (in the legal sense, including a person or a company) of one country obtains a lasting interest in, and a significant degree of influence over, the management of a business enterprise in another country. In the United States and in the international statistical guidelines, the criterion used to define direct investment is ownership of at least 10 percent of the voting securities of an incorporated business enterprise or the equivalent interest in an unincorporated business enterprise. Direct valuation method Method for preparing inflation -adjusted, or “quantity,” estimates for some detailed NIPA components, such as military aircraft. In this method, the quantity estimate for a NIPA component is derived by multiplying actual quantity data for the period being measured by the price of the component in the reference year. Disposable personal income The income available to persons for spending or saving. It is equal to personal income less personal current taxes. Dividend income A form of property income received by shareholders in return for their investment in the equity of a corporation. Domestic capital account Account 6 of the summary NIPAs. This account shows the relationship between saving and investment for the U.S. economy. Domestic income and product account Account 1 of the summary NIPAs. This account shows the production of all sectors of the U.S. economy. The right (product) side of the account shows GDP as the sum of final expenditures, and the left (income) side of the account shows GDP as the sum of the incomes earned and the costs incurred in that production. “Domestic” measures NIPA measures of economic activities that take place in the United States. For example, gross domestic product measures the value of final goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States. Domestic supply The amount of a commodity, valued at producers’ prices, that is available for domestic consumption or fixed investment. It is calculated as domestic production plus imports less exports and less change in inventories. Durable goods Consists primarily of tangible products that can be stored or inventoried and that can be used repeatedly or continuously over a prolonged period. Also includes certain intangible products, such as software. See also “Consumer durable goods” and “Equipment.”",
  "456": "10 Economic asset See “Asset.” Economic Census Mandatory census of economic activity that is conducted every 5 years by the Census Bureau. The basic statistics cover nearly all of the U.S. economy except agriculture and government, and those sectors are covered by concurrent censuses. Employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds Consists of employer payments (including payments in kind) to private pension and profit -sharing plans, government employee retirement plans, private group health and life insurance plans, privately administered workers’ compensation plans, and supplemental unemployment benefit plans. Employer contributions for government social insurance Consists of employer payments under the following federal government and state and local government programs: old-age, survivors, and disability insurance; hospital insurance; unemployment insurance; railroad retirement; pension benefit guaranty; veterans life insurance; publicly administered workers’ compensation; military medical insurance; and temporary disability insurance. Enterprise A business, service, or membership organization consisting of one or more establishments under common, direct or indirect, ownership or control in its capacity as a producer of goods and services. An enterprise may vary in composition from a single -establishment company to a complex family of parent and subsidiary companies (or firms). Equipment Tangible fixed assets (such as new machinery, furniture, and vehicles) — whether purchased or produced for own use —that are used repeatedly, or continuously, in the processes of production for at least a year. Establishment An economic unit —business or industrial —at a single physical location where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed. Examples include a factory, store, hotel, mine, farm, bank, railroad depot, sales office, warehouse, and central administrative office. A single establishment may be comprised of subunits, departments, or divisions, and one or more establishments make up an enterprise or a company. Expenditures approach The measure of GDP as the sum of goods and services purchased by final users —that is, personal consumption expenditures plus gross private domestic investment plus government consumption expenditures and gross investment plus exports of goods and services less imports of goods and services. Exports of goods and services Goods and services that are sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by U.S. residents to foreign residents. Extrapolation A method of extending the estimate for a NIPA component series from a given period forward (or backward) in time to other periods by using the movements of an indicator series or by using other statistical techniques to approximate the movements of the component series.",
  "457": "11 Final demand The goods and services that are acquired by final users —persons, private businesses, governments, and foreigners. Final expenditures components The categories of expenditures by the final users of GDP: personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, government consumption expenditures and gross investment, and net exports (exports of goods and services less imports of goods and services). Final product The value of goods and services that are produced for final use. For the nation, total gross output less total intermediate product is equal to total final product (or GDP). Final sales of domestic product GDP less change in private inventories. It is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private fixed investment, government consumption expenditures and gross investment, and net exports of goods and services. Final sales to domestic purchasers Gross domestic purchases less change in private inventories. It is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private fixed investment, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. Final sales to private domestic purchasers Final sales to domestic purchasers less government consumption expenditures and gross investment. It is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expe nditures and gross private fixed investment. Final users The ultimate consumers of the final products (goods and services) that are produced by the economy. The final users consist of persons (personal consumption expenditures), private businesses (gross private domestic investment), governments (federal and state and local consumption expenditures and gross investment), and foreigners (net exports of goods and services). Financial accounts of the United States Part of the U.S. system of national economic accounts. The financial accounts of the United States, prepared by the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, record the acquisition of assets throughout the U.S. economy, document the sources of the funds used to acquire those assets, and measure the value of total assets and liabilit ies. Formerly known as the “flow of funds accounts.” Financial assets Consists of all financial claims, shares, and other equity in corporations plus gold bullion held by monetary authorities as a reserve asset. Financial industries NIPA industry classification that consists of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry “finance and insurance” and of bank and other holding companies in the NAICS industry “management of companies and enterprises.”",
  "458": "12 Fisher index Quantity or price index for an aggregate that is computed as the geometric mean of the corresponding Laspeyres and Paasche quantity or price indexes for that aggregate. One characteristic of these indexes is that the Fisher quantity index for an aggregate multiplied by the Fisher price index for that aggregate equals the relative change in current -dollar expenditures —that is, the ratio of the expenditures of the current period to the expenditures of the previous period. In the NIPAs, percent changes in quantities and prices are computed from chain-type indexes that are calculated using a Fisher formula. Fixed assets Produced assets that are used repeatedly, or continuously, in the process of production for more than 1 year. They consist of structures, equipment, and intellectual property products that are owned by private businesses, by nonprofit institutions, by households, and by governments. Fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts Economic accounts prepared by BEA that present estimates (1) of the net stock of fixed assets owned by private businesses and by governments and of the net stock of consumer durable goods owned by households, (2) of the depreciation of those assets, and (3) of the investment flows associated with those assets. Fixed -weighted index An index in which the base -period weights are taken from a designated base period and do not change over time. See “Laspeyres index” and “Paasche index.” Flow of funds accounts See “Financial accounts of the United States.” Foreign direct investment in the United States Represents the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by one foreign resident of at least 10 percent of a U.S. business enterprise (see also “Direct investment”).",

Includes individuals who reside or expect to reside abroad for 1 year or more. Exceptions are made for U.S. students who study abroad, for U.S. residents who travel abroad for medical treatment, and for foreign nationals working at international organizations in the United States, all of which are considered U.S. residents regardless of their length of stay. Similarly, foreign government employees (and their families) stationed in the United States —such as diplomats, consular officials, and members of the armed forces —are considered foreign residents regardless of their length of stay. Affiliates of multinational corporations are considered residents of the country in which they are located, not residents of the country of their parent; thus, foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations are considered foreign residents. In the NIPAs, the “rest of the world” sector consists of foreign residents who are transactors with U.S. residents. The NIPA definition is consistent with the definition of foreign residents in the international transactions accounts (ITAs), but in the NIPAs, residents of the U.S. territories, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands are treated as foreign residents while in the ITAs, they are treated as U.S. residents (see “Territorial adjustment”). Also referred to as “Nonresidents.” Foreign transactions capital account Account 7 of the summary NIPAs. This account presents information on transactions with foreigners involving the acquisition or disposition of nonproduced nonfinancial assets and on capital transfers. Foreign transactions current account Account 5 of the summary NIPAs. This account presents information on exports and imports associated with foreign trade, income receipts and payments, and current taxes and other transfer payments. This account does not include transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of nonproduced nonfinancial assets nor capital transfers, which are shown in the foreign transactions capital account, nor does it include transactions in financial assets and liabilit ies. Frequency The time unit covered by an economic statistic. For example, monthly surveys of retail trade, quarterly estimates of GDP, or annual input- output accounts. General government sector Comprises all federal government and state and local government agencies except government enterprises.

Also includes certain intangible assets (software, research and development, and entertainment, literary, and artistic originals), which are classified as intellectual property products. Goods - producing industries NIPA classification that consists of the following NAICS sectors: agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; and manufacturing. Government consumption expenditures and gross investment The government component of final demand in the NIPAs. It comprises two components: (1) government consumption expenditures, which consists of spending by general government to produce and provide services to the public; and (2) government gross investment, which consists of spending by both general government and government enterprises for fixed assets that benefi t the public or that are used by government agencies in their production activities. It excludes government spending for social benefits, grants, and subsidies. Government enterprises Government agencies that cover a substantial proportion of their operat ing costs by selling goods and services to the public and that maintain their own separate accounts. Examples are the U.S. Postal Service and public water and sewage agencies. Government receipts and expenditures Account 4 of the summary NIPAs. This account summarizes the combined transactions of federal, state, and local governments. Gross capital formation See “Gross domestic investment.” Gross domestic income (GDI) The value of the incomes earned and costs incurred in the production of goods, services, and structures in the nation’s economy. GDI is equal to the sum of compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, net operating surplus, and consumption of fixed capital. In theory GDI should equal GDP, but in practice, they differ because their components are estimated using largely independent and less-than-perfect source data; this difference is termed the “statistical discrepancy.” Gross domestic fixed investment Gross private fixed investment plus gross government fixed investment. Gross domestic investment Gross private domestic investment plus gross government fixed investment. Also equal to gross domestic fixed investment plus change in private inventories. Gross domestic product (GDP) BEA’s featured measure of U.S. production. GDP is the market value of the goods, services, and structures produced by the nation’s economy in a particular period less the value of the goods and services used up in production. GDP is calculated as the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. GDP is also equal to the sum of value added by industry across all industries.",
  "461": "15 Gross domestic product (GDP) by industry GDP by industry measures the contribution of each private industry and of government to the nation’s output, or GDP. An industry's GDP, or it s \"value added,\" is equal to its gross output minus its intermediate inputs. Gross domestic product (GDP) by industry accounts Part of BEA’s annual industry accounts. The GDP -by-industry accounts, prepared by BEA, provide estimates of value added—gross output minus intermediate inputs —and the composition of value added for private industry and for government. Gross domestic product (GDP) by metropolitan area Part of BEA’s regional economic accounts, these estimates are the local area counterpart of the nation’s GDP. The estimates are computed by applying the state ratio of GDP to earnings by place of work to local estimates of earnings by place of work. Gross domestic product (GDP) by state Part of BEA’s regional economic accounts, these estimates are the state counterpart of the nation’s GDP. For each state, an estimate of value added is calculated for each industry as the sum of the incomes earned by labor and capital and the costs incurred in the production of goods and services. Gross domestic product (GDP) price index NIPA index that measures the prices of final goods and services produced by the U.S. economy. It is derived from the prices of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. It differs from the gross domestic purchases price index in that it excludes the prices of goods and services that were produced abr oad and sold in the United States (imports), and it includes the prices of goods and services that were produced in the United States and sold abroad (exports). Gross domestic purchases The market value of final goods and services purchased by U.S. residents, regardless of where those goods and services were produced. Gross domestic purchases is equal to GDP less net exports of goods and services. It is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. Gross domestic purchases price index BEA’s featured measure of price change in the U.S. economy is the percent change in this index. This index measures the prices of final goods and services purchased by U.S. residents. It is derived from the prices of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. It differs from the GDP price index in that it excludes the prices of exports of goods and services, and it includes the prices of imports of goods and services. Gross fixed capital See “Gross domestic fixed investment.”",

Gross national product (GNP) The market value of the goods, services, and structures produced by labor and property supplied by U.S. residents. GNP is equal to GDP plus income receipts from the rest of the world less income payments to the rest of the world, and it is conceptually equivalent to gross national income (though it is estimated using different source data). Gross operating surplus A profits -like measure that shows gross private and government enterprise income after subtracting compensation of employees and “taxes on production and imports less subsidies” from gross value added, but before subtracting consumption of fixed capital, financing costs (such as net interest), and other payments (such as business current transfer payments). It is equal to net operating surplus plus consumption of fixed capital. Gross output The value of goods and services produced by the nation ’s economy, principally measured using industry sale s or receipts, including sales to final users (GDP) and sales to other industries (intermediate inputs). Gross private domestic investment The private -investment component of final demand in the NIPAs. It comprises gross private fixed investment and change in private inventories.

The economic activities of households that are included in this sector are the services of owner -occupied housing and the compensation of domestic workers. Other market -oriented household activities, such as sole proprietorships and rental of tenant -occupied housing, are treated in the NIPAs as noncorporate business in the business sector. Implicit price deflator (IPD) A NIPA price measure that is derived by dividing the current -dollar value of an aggregate or component by its corresponding chained -dollar value, and then multiplying by 100. For all periods, the values of the IPD are very close to the values of the corresponding chain -type price index. Imports of goods and services Goods and service s that are sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by foreign residents to U.S. residents. Imputation An estimation of the dollar value of certain economic transactions where market prices do not fully reflect the value of the transaction or where the service is provided without a monetary exchange. In the NIPAs, the largest imputations are for the rental value of owner -occupied housing, where the provision for housing services to the occupant does not involve an exchange between transactors, and for services provided by banks and other financial institutions without an explicit charge. Income and outlay account An economic account that records the sources of income for an economy, sector, or other economic entity, its current outlays, and its saving.

In general, an indicator series is available sooner or more frequently than the component series but is based on less comprehensive source data. Industry A group of establishments or companies that are engaged in the same or similar types of economic activity. In the U.S. statistical system, establishments are classified into industries based on the North American Industry Classification System.

The industry accounts, prepared by BEA, include the annual industry accounts, the benchmark input -output accounts, and the travel and tourism satellite accounts for the United States. Input -output (I -O) tables A set of make, use, and supplementary tables that trace the flow of goods and services among industries in the production process, show the value added by each industry, and provide the detailed commodity composition of national output. See also “Annual I -O accounts” and “Benchmark I-O accounts.” Institutional unit An economic entity (such as a business, household, or local government) that is capable, in its own right, of owning assets, incurring liabilit ies, and in engaging in economic activities and in transactions with other entities. Intellectual property products Intangible fixed assets —whether purchased or produced for own use— that are used repeatedly, or continuously, in the processes of production for at least a year. In the NIPAs, these products consist of software, of research and development, and of entertainment, literary, and artistic originals. (For practical reasons, the NIPAs include mineral exploration within its estimates of nonresidential structures, even though the output of mineral exploration can be considered to be an intellectual property product.) Interest income A form of property income received by the owners of certain kinds of financial assets (such as deposits, debt securities, and loans) in return for their investment in those assets.",
  "465": "19 Intermediate inputs Goods and services —such as energy, materials, and purchased services — that are used for the production of other goods and services rather than for final consumption. Intermediate inputs do not include the inputs from the primary factors of production (capital and labor) that are components of value added.

International investment position accounts (IIPs) Part of BEA’s international economic accounts, the IIP accounts summarize the value of accumulated stocks of U.S. -owned assets abroad and of foreign-owned assets in the United States. The difference between the assets and liabilities is the net IIP of the United States. Separate statistics are available for the value of accumulated stocks of official assets, of U.S. government assets other than official reserve assets, of direct, portfolio, and other investment, and of financial derivatives. International transactions accounts (ITAs) Part of BEA’s international economic accounts, the ITAs summarize transactions between U.S. residents and foreign residents. The ITAs consist of three accounts: the current account records trade in goods and services, receipts and payments of income, and current transfers; the capital account records capital transfers, such as debt forgiveness and the acquisition or disposition of nonproduced nonfinancia l assets; and the financial account records transactions for official assets, for U.S. government assets other than official reserve assets, for direct, portfolio, and other investment, and on a net basis, transactions for financial derivatives. Also refer red to as “Balance of payments accounts.” Interpolation A method of filling in estimates for a NIPA component series between two time periods by using the movements of an indicator series or by using other statistical techniques to approximate the movements of the component series. For example, an annual survey, (such as the Census Bureau annual retail trade survey) may be used to derive the annual estimate for a component series, and a monthly survey (such as the Census Bureau monthly retail trade survey) is used to derive the intervening monthly and quarterly estimates while maintaining consistency with the more accurate annual source data. Inventories Stocks of goods held by a firm. Inventories consist of (1) materials and supplies held for use i n the production of goods for sale or in the provision of a service, (2) “work -in-progress” products that are partly processed and that require further processing prior to sale, (3) finished goods held for sale, and (4) products purchased for resale, generally held by wholesalers and retailers.",
  "466": "20 Inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) An adjustment that is made to the NIPA estimates of change in private inventories and of corporate profits and proprietors’ income so that they are valued consistently in current prices. The IVA accounts for the difference between the acquisition and the withdrawal value of inventories in certain methods of business accounting, which may arise when the price of a good changes while the good is held in inventory. A negative (positive) IVA represents gains (losses) to the business that are attributable to holding inventories rather than to current production. A corresponding adjustment is made to the estimates of corporate profits and of proprietors’ income so that these incomes are associated with current production. Kind of business (KB) Term used by the Census Bureau to describe the industry classification of an establishment on the basis of its major activity. Laspeyres index A quantity or price index for an aggregate in which the formula weights are taken from a designated base period and do not change over time. For example, in computing a Laspeyres quantity index, the quantities in each time period are multiplied by the base -period prices. Laspeyres indexes are relatively easy to compute and analyze, but they do not capture substitutions between items over time, and their movements are highly dependent on the choice of the base period. Legal form of organization System that is used to classify the NIPA measures of national income and its components by the type of income recipient. This system is largely based on the criteria used by the Internal Revenue Service to determine the tax -filing requirements for corporate business and for noncorporate business.

Sometimes referred to as “markup” or “trade markup.” Market -based personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index A supplemental PCE price measure that is based on household expenditures for which there are observable price measures (primarily consumer price indexes and producer price indexes). It excludes most implicit prices (for example, financial services furnished without payment) and the final consumption expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households. Market production Production of goods and services that are produced for sale at prices that are “economically significant”—that is, at prices that have a significant influence on the amounts that producers are willing to supply and that purchasers are willing to buy. Merchant wholesalers Wholesalers that sell goods on their own account —that is, they buy the goods, usually maintain them in warehouses, and then resell them. Under the North American Industry Classification System, merchant wholesalers include sales offices and sales branches that are maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their factories or mines for the purpose of marketing their products. Misreporting adjustment See “Tax misreporting adjustment.” National economic accounts A system of accounts that organizes economic information in a way that describes the economic activities of a nation. The U.S. national economic accounts consist of the NIPAs and the industry economic accounts, both of which are prepared by BEA, and the financial accounts of the United States, which are prepared by the Federal Reserve Board. The accounting concepts and principles are generally based on international guidelines set forth in the SNA. Related accounts include BEA’s international economic accounts and regional economic accounts. National income The sum of all net incomes (net of consumption of fixed capital) earned in current production. It is equal to gross national income less consumption of fixed capital, to net national product less the statistical discrepancy, and to net domestic income plus income receipts from the rest of the world less income payments to the rest of the world.

Perpetual - inventory method A method used by BEA to prepare estimates of the net stock of fixed assets, which, in turn, are used in deriving the NIPA estimates of consumption of fixed capital. For each type of asset, the net stock in each year is calculated as the cumulative value of gross investment through that year less the cumulative value of depreciation through that year. A variation of this method that omits depreciation is used to derive the stocks of private inventories. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) Primary measure of consumer spending in the U.S. economy. It is the NIPA final -dem and component that measures the value of the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, “persons” who reside in the United States.

Quantity extrapolation method Method for preparing inflation -adjusted, or “quantity,” estimates for some detailed NIPA components, such as, for example, compensation of state and local government employees. In this method, the quantity estimate for a NIPA component is derived by multiplying the base-year value of the component by a quantity indicator series that is set equal to 1 in the reference year. Quantity index A weighted average of the proportionate changes in the quantities of a set of goods or services between two periods of time. Quantity indexes for adjacent pairs of periods can be “chained” (multiplied) together to form chain -type quantity indexes (see “Chain -type indexes). Real disposable personal income Inflation -adjusted measure of disposable personal income that is calculated by deflation using the personal consumption expenditure price index as the deflator. Real estimates See “Quantity estimates.” Real gross domestic income (Real GDI) A NIPA alternative measure of changes in U.S. production relative to the reference year, adjusted for inflation. It is calculated by deflating gross domestic income (the sum of incomes earned and costs incurred in the production of GDP) using the GDP price index as the deflator, and thus it is conceptually equivalent to rea l GDP. In contrast, in the SNA, real GDI is a measure of the purchasing power of the total incomes generated by domestic production, adjusting for changes in the terms of trade; in the NIPAs, this measure is termed “command -basis GDP.”",
  "475": "29 Real gross domestic product (Real GDP) BEA’s featured measure of domestic production. It measures U.S. production relative to the reference year, adjusted for inflation. It is calculated as a chain - type quantity index and is also presented in chained dollars. Reference period In the derivation of quantity or price estimates, the period (usually a year) for which an index is set equal to 100, and a real value is set equal to the current -dollar value. Regional economic accounts Prepared by BEA, these accounts consist of the estimates of GDP by state and by metropolitan area and of personal income by state and by local area. Rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment The net income of persons (except those primarily engaged in the real estate business) from the rental of real property, the imputed net rental income of owner occupants of dwellings, and the royalties received by persons from patents, copyrights, and rights to natural resources. Residential equipment Component of residential fixed investment that consists of equipment (such as furniture and household appliances) that is purchased by landlords and included in the rental to tenants. Residential fixed Component of gross private fixed investment that covers all private residential structures and residential equipment. Residential structures Component of residential fixed investment that consists of new construction of permanent -site single -family and multifamily units (excluding land), improvements (a dditions, alterations, and major structural replacements) to housing units, expenditures on manufactured homes, ownership transfer costs (including brokers’ commissions on the sale of residential property), and net purchases of used structures from government agencies. Residential structures also includes some types of equipment that are built into the structure (such as heating and air conditioning equipment). Residual seasonality Seasonality in a time series that exists even after the series has been adjusted to remove seasonal effects. See “seasonality ” and “seasonal adjustment. ” Residual seasonality can be caused by inconsistencies arising from (1) the way monthly source data are utilized in the compi lation of quarterly estim ates, (2) revision policies and practices that prevent the most recent seasonal adjustments from being applied to historical time series, and (3) transformations of the adjusted series —such as aggregation, int erpolation, or deflation— that are necessary to derive the NIPA estimates. Rest-of-the-world sector Consists of foreign residents who conduct transactions with U.S. residents.",
  "476": "30 Retail control method A method used by BEA to prepare nonbenchmark -year and quarterly estimates for most components of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for goods. The retail control method provides the indicator series that are used in interpolating and extrapolating the estimates for most PCE goods components, and it provides the aggregate indicator of the period-to -period change for this group of components. In this method, data on sales by kind of business from annual and monthly retail trade surveys are allocated among these PCE categories (known as the PCE control group) based on product -line data from the economic census. The detailed component estimates are then scaled so that they aggregate to the PCE control group’s period -to-period change. Retail margin The value added by retailers in the chain of distribution of a commodity from the producer to the final purchaser. Sometimes referred to as “retail markup.” Satellite accounts Supplemental accounts that expand the analytical capacity of the main system of accounts by focusing on a particular aspect of economic activity. Satellite accounts are linked to the main accounts but have greater flexibility in providing more detailed information or in using alternative definitions, concepts, and accounting conventions. For example, BEA’s travel and tourism satellite account provides detailed information on output, supply, demand, and employment for those industries. Saving and investment account See “Capital account.” Seasonality Variation in a time series that occurs at about the same time and in about the same magnitude within each year as a result of recurring circumstances, such as weather or holidays. See “residual seasonality” and “seasonal adjustment.” Seasonal adjustment Statistical adjustment of a time series that removes the average effect of variations that normally occur at about the same time and in about the same magnitude within each year —for example, the effects of weather or of holidays. After seasonal adjustment, trends, business cycles, and other movements in the time series stand out more clearly. See “seasonality” and “residual seasonality.” “Second” quarterly estimates This vintage of the current quarterly NIPA estimates is released near the end of the second month that follows the end of the reference quarter. For most GDP components, the second estimate is based on source data for all 3 months of the quarter, some of which may have been revised since the “advance” estimate and some of which may still be subject to further revision.",
  "477": "31 Sector Refers to a major subdivision of units in the economy. In the NIPAs, the term is used both (1) in the classification of institutional units and (2) in the classification of economic activities. (1) A group of institutional units that are similar in function, behavior, and objectives and whose accounts are consolidated to facilitate analysis. In the NIPAs, the three principal sectors for domestic production are business, households and institutions, and general government. (2) In the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), one of 20 major areas of economic activity; the sectors are generally at the two - digit NAICS level (though manufacturing, retail, and transportation and warehousing span several two -digit codes). Services Products, such as medical care and transportation, that cannot be stored and that generally are consumed at the place and time of their purchase. Services - producing industries BEA classification that consists of the following North American Industry Classification System sectors: utilities; wholesale trade; retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; finance and insurance; real estate and rental and leasing; professional, scientific, and technical services; management of companies and enterprises; administrative and waste management services; educational services; h ealth care and social assistance; arts, entertainment, and recreation; accommodation and food services; and other services (except government). Sole proprietorships In classification by legal form of organization in the NIPAs, sole proprietorships comprises all entities that are required to file IRS Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business) or Schedule F (Profit or Loss From Farming) or would be if the proprietor met the filing requirements. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Former U.S. system of industrial classification that groups establishments according to the similarity of their primary activity —that is, the principal product or group of products produced or distributed, or the principal services rendered. The SIC is the primary industrial classification used for the NIPA estimates of private inventories before 1998 and of income by indus try before 2001. The North American Industry Classification System replaced the SIC as the primary industry classification system for the more recent period estimates (see “North American Industry Classification System”). State personal income Part of BEA’s regional economic accounts, these estimates measure the income received by, or on the behalf of, the residents of a state. Estimates are prepared by place of work and by place of residence.",
  "478": "32 Statistical discrepancy The difference between the NIPA measure of production that is derived as the sum of final expenditures (GDP) and its counterpart measure that is derived as the sum of the costs incurred and the incomes earned in production (gross domestic income). The statistical discrepancy arises from the independent estimation of the two measures using different source data and methods. It is recorded in the NIPAs as an “income” component that reconciles the income side with the product side of the accounts. Structures Fixed assets, such as comme rcial buildings and highways, that are usually constructed at the location where they will be used and that typically have long economic lives. Subsidies Payments from government agencies to private business (for example, federal subsidies to farmers) and to government enterprises (for example, federal subsidies to state and local public housing authorities) to support their current operations. In contrast, payments associated with the acquisition or disposal of assets are classified as capital transfers. Supplements to wages and salaries Consists of employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and of employer contributions for government social insurance. Survey of Current Business BEA’s monthly journal of record. Articles in the Survey present the latest national, international, regional, and industry estimates; describe the methodologies used to prepare the estimates; provide information about revisions; and discuss on-going research. System of National Accounts (SNA) An international set of guidelines for a system of economic accounts, published by the Commission for the European Communities, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, the United Nations, and the World Bank. The SNA organizes information about the flows and stocks that describe an economy within a comprehensive, integrated framework. The SNA provides the general accounting framework for the national economic accounts for the United States and other countries. The most recent edition of the SNA was published in 2008. Taxes on production and imports Taxes payable on products when they are produced, delivered, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by their producers (such as federal excise taxes, custom duties, and state and local sales taxes). Also includes other taxes on production, such as taxes on ownership of assets used in production (for example, local r eal estate taxes, motor vehicle licenses, severance taxes, and special assessments). Does not include personal and corporate income taxes and personal property taxes. Tax-exempt cooperative A nonprofit business organization that is collectively owned by its members. In the NIPAs, these organizations are classified in the “other” private business sector, and their income is classified as proprietors’ income.",
  "479": "33 Tax misreporting An adjustment made by BEA to IRS tax-return data in order to account for underreported income or for illegal nonfiling of tax returns. Terms of trade A measure of the relationship between the prices that are received by U.S. producers for exports of goods and services and the prices that are paid by U.S. purchasers for imports of goods and services. It is calculated as the ratio of the price index for exports of goods and services to the price index for imports of goods and services. Ratios for the terms of trade in goods and in nonpetroleum goods are also prepared. “Third” quarterly estimates This vintage of the current quarterly NIPA estimates is released near the end of the third month that follows the end of the reference quarter. These estimates incorporate any revisions to the monthly source data since the “second” quarterly estimate and newly available quarterly source data. With the exception of wages and salaries and income aggregates related to it, these estimates will not be revised again until the next annual or comprehensive update of the NIPAs. Territorial adjustment An adjustment that is made to the international transactions accounts (ITAs) to make the geographical coverage consistent with that of the NIPAs. The adjustments are made to transactions between the United States and its territories, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands, which are treated as part of the United States in the ITAs but are included in the rest of the world in the NIPAs. Transfer A transaction in which one party provides a good, service, or asset to another party without receiving anything directly in return. U.S. direct investment abroad Represents the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by one U.S. resident of at least 10 percent of a foreign business enterprise (see also “Direct investment”).",
  "480": "34 U.S. residents Comprises (1) individuals residing permanently in the United States, (2) business enterprises and nonprofit organizations established under U.S. laws, including corporations, partnerships, and proprietorships; and (3) U.S. federal, state, and local governments, together with their subdivisions. Includes individuals who reside or expect to reside in the United States for 1 year or more. Exceptions are made for foreign students who study in the United States and for foreigners who travel to the United States for medical treatment, both of which are considered foreign residents regardless of their length of stay. Similarly, U.S. government employees stationed abroad (and their families) —such as diplomats, consular officials, and members of the armed forces —are also considered U.S. residents regardless of their length of stay. Affiliates of multinational corporations are considered residents of the country in which they are located, not residents of the country of the parent; thus, U.S. affiliates of foreign corporations are considered U.S. residents. The NIPA definition is consistent with the definition of U.S. residents in the international transactions accounts (ITAs), but in the NIPAs, residents of the U.S. territories, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands are treated as foreign residents while in the ITAs, they are treated as U.S. residents (see “Territorial adjustme nt”). U.S. Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts (TTSAs) Annual accounts that provide a detailed picture of travel and tourism activity and its role in the U.S. economy. The TTSAs present estimates of expenditures by tourists or other visitors on 24 types of goods and services. The accounts also present estimates of the income generated by travel and tourism and estimates of the output and the employment generated by industries associated with travel and tourism. Value added For the nation, total value added (or GDP) is the value of all the goods and services produced by the economy (gross output) less the value of those goods and services that are used in the production process (total intermediate inputs). Value added consists of compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, and gross operating surplus. For an individual industry, value added is equal to gross output (sales or receipts plus other operating income and inventory change) less intermediate inputs (consumpti on of goods and services purchased from other industries or imported). Value -added approach The measurement of GDP as the sum of the value added by each industry at each stage of production.",
  "481": "35 Wages and salaries The total remuneration, in cash and in kind, of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; voluntary employee contributions to certain deferred compensation 401(k) plans; employee gains from nonqualified stock options; receipts - in-kind; and mis cellaneous compensation of employees, such as judicial fees to jurors and to witnesses. Wholesale margin The value added by wholesalers in the chain of distribution of a commodity from the producer to the final purchaser. Sometimes referred to as “wholesale markup.” GDP Gross domestic product NIPAs National income and product accounts SNA System of National Accounts"
