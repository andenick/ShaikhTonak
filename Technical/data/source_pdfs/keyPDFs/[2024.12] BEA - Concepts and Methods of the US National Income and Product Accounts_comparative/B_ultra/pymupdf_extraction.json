    "text": "Table of Contents CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION The U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs) are a set of economic accounts that provide the framework for presenting detailed measures of U.S. output and income. This chapter introduces the NIPAs by answering several basic questions about their nature and purpose. CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS The NIPAs are based on a consistent set of concepts and definitions. This chapter establishes the type and scope of the economic activities that are covered by the NIPA measures, and it describes several of the principal NIPA measures of these activities. It then discusses the classifications used in presenting the NIPA estimates, and it describes the accounting framework that underlies the NIPAs. CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA The NIPAs incorporate a vast amount of data from a variety of public and private sources. This chapter describes the principal source data that are used to prepare the current quarterly NIPA estimates, to prepare the annual revisions of the NIPAs, and to prepare the quinquennia l comprehensive revisions of the NIPAs. CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS Estimating methods are the steps that are taken to transform source data into estimates that are consistent with the concepts, definitions, and framework of the NIPAs. This chapter briefly describes some of the general methods that are used to prepare the current-dollar, quantity, and price estimates for the NIPAs. An appendix describes some of the statistical tools and conventions that are used in preparing and presenting the NIPA estimates. CHAPTER 5: PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) is the NIPA measure of consumer purchases of goods and services in the U.S. economy. A technical note at the end of the chapter provides additional detail on the methodology for a number of key PCE components.",

A technical note at the end of the chapter provides additional detail on the methodology for several key PFI components. CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES Change in private inventories is the NIPA measure of the value of the change in the physical volume of inventories owned by private businesses in the U.S. economy. Appendixes at the end of the chapter illustrate the relationship between business and NIPA inventory accounting and the basic steps used in the NIPA inventory calculations. CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES Net exports of goods and services is the difference between U.S. exports of goods and services, the NIPA measure of the portion of U.S. production that is provided to the rest of the world, and imports of goods and services, the NIPA measure of the portion of U.S. expenditures that is accounted for foreign-produced goods and services. CHAPTER 9: GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND GROSS INVESTMENT Government consumption expenditures and gross investment is the NIPA measure of the portion of final expenditures that is accounted for by the government sector. In the NIPAs, government is treated as both a consumer/investor and a producer of goods and services. CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES Compensation measures the total income—both wages and salaries and supplements to wages and salaries—earned by employees in return for contributing to production during an accounting period. CHAPTER 11: NONFARM PROPRIETORS’ INCOME Nonfarm proprietors’ income provides a comprehensive and consistent economic measure of the income earned by all U.S. unincorporated nonfarm businesses.

How useful are the NIPA estimates? How are the NIPA estimates prepared? Why are the NIPA estimates revised? Where are the NIPA estimates available? What are the NIPAs? The National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) are one of the three major elements of the U.S. national economic accounts. The NIPAs present the value and composition of national output and the types of incomes generated in its production. (For information on the concepts and definitions underlying the NIPAs, see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts.”) The other major elements of the U.S. national economic accounts are the Industry Economic Accounts (IEAs), which are also prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and the Financial Accounts of the United States, (formerly the flow of funds accounts), which are prepared by the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The IEAs consist of the input-output (I-O) accounts, which trace the flow of goods and services among industries in the production process and which show the value added by each industry and the detailed commodity composition of national output, and the gross domestic product (GDP) by industry accounts, which measure the contribution of each private industry and of government to GDP.1 The financial accounts record the acquisition of nonfinancial and financial assets (and the incurrence of liabilities) throughout the U.S. economy, the sources of the funds used to acquire those assets, and the value of assets held and of liabilities owed.2 In addition, BEA prepares two other sets of U.S. economic accounts: the international accounts, which consist of the International Transactions Accounts (formerly known as balance of payments accounts) and the International Investment Position accounts; and the Regional Economic Accounts (REAs), which consist of the 1 See Mary L. Streitwieser, “Measuring the Nation’s Economy: An Industry Perspective/A Primer on BEA’s Industry Accounts,” and U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Concepts and Methods of the U.S. Input-Output Accounts; both are available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 2 See U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Guide to the Flow of Funds Accounts (Board of Governors, Washington, DC, 2006); and see Albert M.

Altogether, the system of U.S. economic accounts presents a coherent, comprehensive, and consistent picture of U.S. economic activity (see Figure 1). The NIPAs provide information to help answer three basic questions. First, what is the output of the economy—its size, its composition, and its use? Second, what are the sources and uses of national income? Third, what are the sources of saving, which provides for investment in future production? The NIPA estimates are presented in a set of integrated accounts that show U.S. production, income, consumption, investment, and saving. The conceptual framework of the accounts is illustrated by seven summary accounts, and detailed estimates are provided in approximately 300 supporting NIPA tables. The NIPA information is supplemented by a set of fixed-asset accounts, which show the U.S. stock of fixed assets and consumer durable goods.4 The NIPAs feature some of the most closely watched economic statistics that influence the decisions made by government officials, businesses, and households. 3 For more information on BEA’s international or regional estimates, go to www.bea.gov; select “Resources” and then “Methodologies.” 4 See U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, 1925-97, (September 2003), available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov.

    "text": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-3 Foremost among these estimates is GDP, the most widely recognized measure of the nation’s production. In particular, the quarterly estimates of inflation-adjusted GDP provide the most comprehensive picture of current economic conditions in the United States. Other key NIPA estimates include the monthly estimates of personal income and outlays, which provide current information on consumer income, spending, and saving, and the quarterly estimates of corporate profits, which provide an economic measure of U.S. corporate financial performance. How did the NIPAs originate? Prior to the development of official statistics in the 1930s, there were only fragmentary and sometimes conflicting data on the state of the economy. This lack of comprehensive economic data hampered efforts to develop policies to combat the Great Depression. In response to this need, and in keeping with the economic identity that “income equals production,” the U.S. Department of Commerce commissioned future Nobel Laureate Simon Kuznets to develop estimates of national income to serve as an indicator of both U.S. income and U.S. output.5 He coordinated the work of a group of researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research and of his staff at the Commerce Department, and initial estimates were presented in a 1934 report to the U.S. Senate, National Income, 1929–32. Shortly thereafter, work began on monthly measures that could track income developments more quickly. These measures of income payments to individuals were first published in 1938 and were the predecessor of BEA’s personal income estimates. They revealed their usefulness immediately, as they showed that incomes had dropped 11 percent from a post-Great Depression peak in August 1937 to the recession trough in March 1938. Annual statistics could not track these developments. Similar efforts occurred internationally. In 1928, the League of Nations held the International Conference Relating to Economic Statistics to encourage countries to develop internationally comparable official statistics. As in the United States, the Great Depression underscored the urgency of developing reliable economic measures and in 1939 the League of Nations published national income estimates for 26 countries. As with the United States’ measures, the usefulness of the measures was quickly recognized. The planning needs for a wartime economy in the United States in the early 1940s highlighted the need for a measure of national production that could answer questions that national income measures could not address, such as the tradeoffs associated with mobilizing for war. Annual estimates of “gross national expenditure,” which gradually evolved to gross national product (GNP), were introduced early in 1942 to provide information about major categories of expenditures in the economy; the measure also 5 The proposition that for a country as a whole, goods and services produced must equal incomes earned by its residents is precisely true only for a closed economy. In the 1930s, when statistical measures were being formulated and international flows were relatively small, the identity was retained by using a measure of production derived from labor and capital supplied by U.S. residents wherever the production takes place— that is, gross national product rather than gross domestic product.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-4 served as a complement to the estimates of national income.6 Over time, both the income and expenditure measures were refined and expanded. The first U.S. national income and product statistics were presented as part of a complete and consistent double-entry accounting system in the summer of 1947. The accounts presented a framework for classifying and recording the economic transactions among major sectors: households, businesses, government, and international (termed “rest of the world”). This framework placed the GNP statistics in the broader context of the economy as a whole and provided a more complete picture of how the economy works.7 International efforts also continued, and after the war, the League’s Committee of Statistical Experts formed a Sub-Committee on National Income Statistics, which produced a report in 1947, written by Sir Richard Stone.8 This report was the foundation of the modern-day System of National Accounts (SNA)—the internationally accepted guidelines for the compilation of national accounts. How have the NIPAs evolved? The evolution of the NIPAs from their earliest origins in the 1930s to their current form exemplifies the balance between theoretically ideal measures, the availability of source data and other resources, and the economic questions of the day. Put another way, the NIPAs evolved, and continue to evolve, in an effort to produce the best possible measures of the economy that are at once accurate, reliable, and relevant. The improvements BEA introduced into its accounts over the years have reflected its own experience, research and strategic planning, and the recommendations of scholars and other experts. For example, in the 1950s, there were two major reviews of the accounts, one by the National Bureau of Economic Research and another by the Conference on Research in Income and Wealth.9 In 1971, BEA published a special volume commemorating its 50th anniversary that contained recommendations contributed by some of the country’s most prominent economists.10 Also in the 1970s, reports were prepared by the Advisory Committee on Gross National Product Data Improvement and by the Conference on Research in Income and Wealth; in 1982, the General Accounting 6 Until 1991, GNP was the featured measure of U.S. production.

Since 1993, BEA has incorporated many improvements to the NIPAs and its other economic accounts that have resulted in increased consistency with major SNA guidelines on GDP, investment, and saving.14 As a result of these continuous efforts, at the end of 1999, the Commerce Department named the invention and ongoing development of the NIPAs and its marquee measure GDP as “its greatest achievement of the century.”15 The following are examples of some of the major changes that have been introduced into the NIPAs to keep them accurate and relevant in the face of a changing economy. • In the early 1950s, BEA developed and began to publish inflation-adjusted, or “real,” measures of output in response to inflation concerns that had persisted since WWII and in order to assess trends in national productivity and standards of living. Later in the same decade, BEA introduced measures of personal income by size and by state in response to similar needs for information on the composition of consumer markets. Additionally, BEA introduced quarterly measures of real 11 Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, Gross National Product Data Improvement Project Report, report of the Advisory Committee on Gross National Product Data Improvement, Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Commerce, 1977; Murray F.

Interest payments to individuals were excluded from GNP to better reflect productive activity. • In the 1970s, BEA introduced economic measures of capital consumption that were valued at replacement cost rather than historical cost to better reflect the depletion of capital assets and to enhance the picture of the Nation’s productive capacity. • In the 1980s, BEA significantly expanded its coverage of international trade in services in response to the growing size and diversity of these global transactions. • In the 1990s, BEA introduced more accurate measures of real output and of prices, developed estimates of investments in computer software, instituted the treatment of government purchases of structures, equipment, and software as investment, and incorporated improved measures of high-tech products. • In the 2000s, BEA introduced improved measures of insurance and banking services, a new treatment of government as a producer of goods and services, a new treatment of disasters to better reflect the distinctions between current and capital transactions, a new improved format for presenting the NIPAs, and an updated classification system for personal consumption expenditures to provide more useful categories for analysis of spending by households and nonprofit institutions serving households. • In 2013, BEA expanded the asset boundary in the accounts by recognizing expenditures by business, government, and nonprofits institutions serving households for research and development and expenditures by private enterprises for the creation of entertainment, literary, and artistic originals as fixed investment to allow better measurement of the effects of innovation and intangible assets on the economy. BEA also began measuring pension income on an accrual basis. • In 2018, BEA completed a multi-year initiative to improve its seasonal adjustment in the NIPAs, and it introduced measures of GDP and GDI and their major components that are not seasonally adjusted. • In 2020, as part of BEA’s ongoing efforts to harmonize the production and publication of the NIPAs, the IEAs, and the Regional Economic Accounts, BEA synchronized the production and release of quarterly NIPA, IEA, and REA statistics. • In 2022 and 2023, BEA took the final steps in harmonizing its accounts by concurrently producing and publishing annual and comprehensive updates, respectively, of the NIPA, IEA, and REA statistics.

The following are among the principal uses of the NIPA estimates. • Since their inception in the 1930s and 1940s, the NIPAs have become the mainstay of modern macroeconomic analysis. They provide comprehensive and consistent time series that can be used for measuring the long-term path of the U.S. economy, for analyzing trends and identifying factors in economic growth and productivity, and for tracking cyclical fluctuations in economic activity. • The NIPAs provide the basis for macroeconomic forecasting models. These mathematical models are developed using historical NIPA estimates and other variables with the aim of predicting short-term economic activity or long-term economic trends. • Key NIPA estimates serve as primary indicators of the current condition of the U.S. economy. In particular, the releases of the quarterly estimates of GDP and its components, of the quarterly estimates of corporate profits, and of the monthly estimates of personal income and personal consumption expenditures are closely anticipated and followed by Wall Street investors and analysts, the news media, and the general public. • The NIPA estimates provide critical inputs to the formulation and execution of macroeconomic policy and to the assessment of the effects of these policies. They are used by the White House and by Congress in formulating fiscal policy and by the Federal Reserve Board in formulating monetary policy. • The NIPA estimates are used by the White House and Congress in preparing the federal budget and tax projections. • The NIPA estimates are used in comparisons of the U.S. economy with the economies of other nations. Comparable international statistics facilitate assessments of relative economic performance among nations, and they provide the basis for tracking and analyzing the global economy. • Detailed NIPA estimates can be used in examining interrelationships between various sectors of the economy. For example, estimates of benefits paid under government assistance programs track flows of transfer payments from governments to households. • The NIPA estimates are used by businesses and individuals in planning financial and investment strategies. Such planning heavily depends on the near- and long- term prospects for economic growth. • The NIPAs are an important data source for the other national economic accounts and other economic statistics. For example, the NIPA estimates of owner- occupied housing, of motor vehicle output, and of bank-service charges are among the primary source data used in preparing the I-O accounts. In addition, the NIPA estimates are used in various analytical measures; for example, business-sector output is used as the numerator in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ estimates of productivity for the U.S. economy. • The NIPA framework provides the basis for developing analytical tools such as satellite accounts, which are supplementary accounts that focus on a particular aspect of economic activity or on the activities of a specific sector or segment of",

    "text": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-8 the economy. For example, the NIPAs provide the structural and statistical basis for the travel and tourism satellite accounts. How useful are the NIPA estimates? The usefulness of the NIPA estimates is determined by how effective they are in meeting the above needs. This effectiveness may be summarized in terms of four characteristics: accuracy, reliability, relevance, and integrity. Accuracy. Accuracy may be described in terms of how close the estimates come to measuring the concepts they are designed to measure. In the case of GDP, the estimate is accurate when it captures all production for final use but does not include production for intermediate use. In order to keep pace with innovations in the economy, such as the development of new online services, BEA must periodically review and update the definitions and methodologies of the NIPA aggregates and components to ensure that they represent complete and consistent estimates. Reliability. Reliability refers to the size and frequency of revisions to the NIPA estimates. An important indicator of reliability is the effectiveness of the initial estimates of GDP in providing a useful picture of U.S. economic activity. The results of periodic studies have confirmed that the initial estimates provide a reliable indication of whether economic growth is positive or negative, whether growth is accelerating or decelerating, whether growth is high or low relative to trend, and where the economy is in relation to the business cycle.16 Relevance. Relevance has two dimensions. First, relevance refers to the length of time before the estimates become available. Estimates that are not available soon enough for the intended use are not relevant. However, there is an implicit tradeoff between timeliness and accuracy, so BEA has developed a release cycle for the estimates that addresses this tradeoff (see the section “Why are the NIPA estimates revised?”). Second, relevance refers to the ability of the accounts to provide summary and detailed estimates in analytical frameworks that help answer the questions being asked about the economy. Issues of relevance change as the economy changes, as policy concerns evolve, and as economic theory advances; as discussed above, BEA’s accounts have evolved over time in order to maintain their relevance. Integrity. One critical factor underlying the usefulness of the accounts is confidence on the part of users that the NIPA estimates represent a truthful picture of the economy. That is, the preparation and release of the estimates must reflect the best methods and technical judgments available, free from any political or other inappropriate influence. 16 For more information, see Dennis J. Fixler, Eva de Francisco, and Danit Kanal, “Revisions to GDP, GDI, and Their Major Components,” Survey 100 (January 2021).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-9 In recognition of the importance of its statistics and the trust placed in their integrity, BEA strives to make its processes open and transparent and its releases objective and timely. For example, the NIPA estimates that are designated as “principal economic indicators”—GDP, personal income and outlays, and corporate profits—are prepared in accordance with Statistical Policy Directive Number 3 of the Office of Management and Budget, which provides standards for data collection, estimation, and evaluation and for the timely and orderly release of these sensitive economic statistics. BEA employs such standards in the preparation of all of its estimates. As Alan Greenspan, former Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, stated about the national economic accounts, and specifically the estimates of GDP: Though these estimates have a profound influence on markets when published and are the basis for federal budget projections and political rhetoric, I do not recall a single instance when the integrity of the estimates was called into question by informed observers. This is so despite the fact that, for many of the published preliminary figures, judgmental estimates for data not yet available are made, many of which affect the message of the accounts. It is a testament to the professionalism of the analysts that these judgments are never assumed to be driven by political imperatives. This cannot be said of statistical operations of all countries, and I think it is fair to say that the consequent ability of people to make decisions with greater confidence in the information at their disposal has contributed, in at least a small way, to our nation’s favorable economic performance.17 How are the NIPA estimates prepared? The NIPA estimation process starts with identifying and obtaining source data that are appropriate as the basis for the estimates. These data largely originate from public sources, such as government surveys and administrative data, and they are supplemented by data from private sources, such as data from trade associations. (For more information, see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data.”) Ideally, the source data for each detailed component of the NIPAs would correspond exactly to the concepts and structure of the accounts. Additionally, these data would be accurate, would have the needed coverage, would have the appropriate time of recording and valuation, and would be available quickly. In practice, the source data will never meet all of these criteria. Thus, BEA must develop estimating methods that adjust the data to the required concepts and that fill gaps in coverage and timing. (For more information, see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods.”) 17 “GDP: One of the Great Inventions of the 20th Century,” 13.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1-10 Why are the NIPA estimates revised? BEA revises the NIPA estimates for two related reasons. First, as noted earlier, the NIPAs serve a multitude of purposes, some of which require frequent and immediately available estimates and others of which require consistent, long-term time series. Second, much of the source data that BEA uses to prepare the estimates are part of statistical programs that provide, over time, more complete or otherwise better coverage—for example, monthly surveys that are superseded by an annual survey that is drawn from a larger sample or that collects more detailed information. To address this implicit tradeoff between estimates that are the most timely possible and estimates that are the most accurate possible, BEA has developed a release cycle for the NIPA estimates. This cycle progresses from current quarterly estimates, which are released soon after the end of the quarter and which are based on limited source data, to comprehensive-update estimates, which are released about every 5 years and which incorporate the most extensive source data available. For GDP and most other NIPA series, the set of three current quarterly estimates are released on the following schedule. “Advance” estimates are released near the end of the first month after the end of the quarter. Most of these estimates are based on initial data from monthly surveys for either 2 or 3 months of the quarter; where source data are not yet available, the estimates are generally based on previous trends and judgment (see the box “Source Data and Key Assumptions for the Advance Estimates of GDP for the First Quarter of 2014” in the section “Source data for the current estimates” in Chapter 3).18 “Second” and “third” quarterly estimates are released near the end of the second and third months, respectively; these estimates incorporate new and revised data from the monthly surveys and other monthly and quarterly source data that have subsequently become available. The current quarterly estimates provide the first look at the path of U.S. economic activity.19 Annual updates of the NIPAs are released each September.20 These updates incorporate source data that are based on more extensive annual surveys, on annual data from other sources, and on later revisions to the monthly and quarterly source data, and 18 Information on the assumptions used for unavailable source data is provided in a technical note that is posted with the GDP news release on BEA's website. Within a few days after the release, a detailed \"Key Source Data and Assumptions\" file is posted on the website. Additionally, in the middle of each month, an analysis of the current quarterly estimate of GDP and related series, including information on key source data and assumptions, is made available in the Survey of Current Business article \"GDP and the Economy.\" 19 Unless noted otherwise, annual data are presented on a calendar-year basis (i.e., covering January through December). Quarterly data are also presented on a calendar basis (i.e., the first quarter (Q1) covers January, February, and March; Q2 covers April, May, and June; Q3 covers July, August, and September; and Q4 covers October, November, and December). 20 Prior to the 2022 concurrent release of the NIPAs, IEAs, and REAS, the annual update of the NIPAs was typically released in July; the release of all three accounts spanned several months from July to October. The timing was shifted to September to allow a concurrent release of the three accounts.",

Comprehensive updates are carried out at about 5-year intervals and may result in revisions that extend back for many years.22 These estimates incorporate the best available source data, such as data from the quinquennial U.S. Economic Census. Comprehensive updates also provide the opportunity to make definitional, statistical, and presentational changes that improve and modernize the accounts to keep pace with the ever-changing U.S. economy. Thus, these NIPA estimates represent the most accurate and relevant picture of U.S. economic activity. Where are the NIPA estimates available? Information on the NIPA estimates is provided in BEA news releases, in BEA’s monthly journal, the Survey of Current Business, and on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. News releases provide the earliest information on the current quarterly NIPA estimates and the annual and comprehensive revisions of the NIPAs. These releases, which contain a brief description of the estimates and summary data tables, are posted on BEA’s website by 8:30 on the morning of the release in accordance with a previously published schedule. The most comprehensive source of the latest vintage of NIPA data is BEA’s website presentation of the entire set of NIPA tables, which is updated soon after the news release is posted. The website provides the estimates in an interactive environment that enables users to view and download specified tables for selected time spans and in a variety of formats.23 In addition, the website provides descriptions of the methodologies underlying the estimates and release schedules for the estimates, as well as articles and working papers that describe BEA’s current research. Users can be notified via e-mail, RSS feeds, and Twitter accounts of new data releases. The current NIPA estimates are also discussed each month in the article “GDP and the Economy” in the Survey and are presented in a set of selected NIPA tables. The annual and comprehensive updates are described in Survey articles after their release. 21 As part of the 2018 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA changed the typical open period for annual updates of the NIPAs from 3 to 5 years. As part of the “flexible” approach to annual updates that BEA introduced in 2010, the open period may be extended beyond 5 years to allow for the incorporation of improvements in methodology. See Pamela A. Kelly, Stephanie H. McCulla, and David B. Wasshausen, “Improved Estimates of the National Income and Product Accounts: Results of the 2018 Comprehensive Update,” Survey 98 (September 2018) and “BEA Briefing: Improving BEA’s Accounts Through Flexible Annual Revisions,” Survey 88 (June 2008): 29–32. 22 The following is a list of the 16 NIPA comprehensive updates to date: July 1947, July 1951, July 1954, July 1958, August 1965, January 1976, December 1980, December 1985, December 1991, January 1996, October 1999, December 2003, July 2009, July 2013, July 2018, and September 2023. 23 Go to www.bea.gov, and click on “Tools” and then on “Interactive Data.” Interactive tables for BEA’s international, regional and industry economic accounts are also available on the website.",

The presentation of the NIPA tables is organized to group tables by major topic, such as the components of GDP, saving and investment, and income. For example, most government sector tables are shown in section 3. To assist users in identifying the type of estimate in a table, BEA developed a table-numbering system that highlights the type of estimate (such as current dollars, quantity indexes, and percent changes) in the table. The system is outlined below. Table numbers are in the format “X.Y.Z.” where “X” indicates the NIPA table section, “Y” indicates the table family within the section, and “Z” indicates the metric, or type, of estimate presented. The table sections are numbered as follows: 1. Domestic Product and Income 2. Personal Income and Outlays 3. Government Current Receipts and Expenditures 4. Foreign Transactions 5. Saving and Investment 6. Income and Employment by Industry 7. Supplemental Tables 8. Not Seasonally Adjusted The table families within each section (character “Y”) have table stubs, or lines, that are generally the same. The metric types (character “Z”) are numbered as follows: 1. Percent change from preceding period in real estimates (most at annual rates) 2. Contributions to percent change in real estimates 3. Real estimates, quantity indexes 4. Price indexes 5. Current dollars 6. Real estimates, chained dollars 7. Percent change from preceding period in prices 8. Contributions to percent change in prices 9. Implicit price deflators 10.

According to the international System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA), “Economic production may be defined as an activity carried out under the control and responsibility of an institutional unit that uses inputs of labour, capital, and goods and services to produce outputs of goods or services. There must be an institutional unit that assumes responsibility for the process of production and owns any resulting goods or knowledge-capturing products produced or is entitled to be paid, or otherwise compensated, for the change-effecting or margin services provided.”1 1 Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008: 6.24 at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/SNA2008.asp.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-2 Under this definition, certain natural processes may be included in or excluded from production, depending upon whether they are under the ownership or control of an entity in the economy. For example, the growth of trees in an uncultivated forest is not included in production, but the harvesting of the trees from that forest is included. The general definition of the production boundary may then be restricted by functional considerations. In the SNA (and in the U.S. accounts), certain household activities—such as housework, do-it-yourself projects, and care of family members—are excluded, partly because by nature these activities tend to be self-contained and have limited impact on the rest of the economy and because their inclusion would affect the usefulness of the accounts for long-standing analytical purposes, such as business cycle analysis.2 In the U.S. economic accounts, the production boundary is further restricted by practical considerations about whether the productive activity can be accurately valued or measured. For example, illegal activities, such as gambling and prostitution in some states, should in principle be included in measures of production. However, these activities are excluded from the U.S. accounts because they are by their very nature conducted out of sight of public scrutiny and so data are not available to measure them. Asset boundary In general, the boundary for assets in the U.S. economic accounts is comparable to that for production. According to the SNA, assets “are entities that must be owned by some unit, or units, and from which economic benefits are derived by their owner(s) by holding or using them over a period of time.”3 Economic assets may be either financial assets or nonfinancial assets. Financial assets consist of all financial claims—that is, the payment or series of payments due to a creditor by a debtor under the terms of a liability—shares or other equity in corporations plus gold bullion held by monetary authorities as a reserve asset.4 These assets are covered in the financial accounts of the United States, which are maintained by the Federal Reserve Board. Two broad categories of nonfinancial assets are identified. Produced assets are assets that have come into existence as a result of a production process. The three types of produced assets are the following: fixed assets, inventories, and valuables such as precious metals that are primarily held as stores of value. Nonproduced assets are assets that arise from means other than a production process; a primary example is naturally occurring resources, such as mineral deposits and uncultivated forests.5 2 SNA 2008: 6.28–6.29. See also Benjamin Bridgeman, “Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts: An Update, 1965-2020”,” Survey of Current Business 102 (February 2022). 3 SNA 2008: 1.46. 4 SNA 2008: 11.7–11.8. 5 BEA does not prepare estimates of the stocks of nonproduced assets, though it does prepare estimates of net purchases and sales of these assets.

    "text": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-3 At present, BEA prepares estimates of capital stocks for private and government fixed assets, for inventories owned by private business, and for consumer durable goods (which are included in BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts).6 • Fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly, or continuously, in the processes of production for more than 1 year. BEA’s estimates of fixed assets cover structures, equipment, and intellectual property products, but not cultivated assets such as livestock or orchards. The acquisition of fixed assets by private business is included in the NIPA measure “gross private domestic investment,” and the acquisition of fixed assets by government is included in the NIPA measure “government consumption expenditures and gross investment.” The depreciation of fixed assets—that is, the decline in their value due to physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event—is captured in the NIPA measure “consumption of fixed capital.”7 • The stock of private inventories consists of materials and supplies, work in process, finished goods, and goods held for resale. The change in private inventories is included in the NIPA measure “gross private domestic investment.” • Consumer durable goods are tangible commodities purchased by consumers that can be used repeatedly or continuously for a prolonged period (for example, motor vehicles). Purchases of these goods are included in the NIPA measure “personal consumption expenditures.” Thus, in the NIPAs, acquisitions of fixed assets by private business and by government are treated as investment, but acquisitions of consumer durable goods by households are treated as consumption expenditures rather than as investment.8 Sometimes, the asset boundary may change as a result of changes in definition or in the ability to measure or value an asset. For example, in the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA introduced two major changes that broadened the definition of fixed investment and thus expanded the boundary of its capital stock estimates. First, BEA began treating expenditures by business, government, and nonprofit institutions serving households for research and development as fixed investment. Second, BEA began treating expenditures by business and nonprofit institutions serving households on entertainment, literary, and other artistic originals as fixed investment. These changes recognize that these intangible assets have ownership rights, are long-lasting, and are mineral resources. See “Integrated Economic and Environmental Satellite Accounts,” Survey 74 (April 1994): 33–49; and “Accounting for Mineral Resources: Issues and BEA’s Initial Estimates,” Survey 74 (April 1994): 50–72. 6 See “Fixed Assets,” in BEA’s “Interactive Data,” at www.bea.gov. 7 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of disasters in which the value of irreparable damage to, or the destruction of, fixed assets is no longer recorded as consumption of fixed capital; see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, “Preview of the 2009 Comprehensive Revision of the NIPAs: Changes in Definitions and Presentations,” Survey 89 (March 2009): 10-27. 8 However, estimates of the stocks of consumer durables are included in household balance sheets in the Federal Reserve Board’s financial accounts of the United States as well as in BEA’s capital stock estimates.",

Private investment in research and development and in entertainment originals, along with that in software (which has been treated as a fixed asset since the 1999 comprehensive NIPA revision), is now shown in the NIPAs in the subcategory “intellectual property products” in nonresidential fixed investment. Similarly, government investment in research and development, along with that in software, is shown in “intellectual property products” in gross government fixed investment. Also as part of the 2013 comprehensive update, BEA began recognizing as capital investment all of the nonfinancial ownership transfer costs that are associated with the purchase of a residential asset. These costs include title insurance; title, abstract, and attorney fees; payments for state and local government documentary and stamp taxes; and payments for surveys and engineering services; as well as the previously capitalized brokers’ commissions on the sale of residential structures.9 Market and nonmarket output The output that is included in the economic accounts is classified as “market,” “produced for own use,” or “nonmarket.” Most production and distribution takes place within the market economy—that is, goods and services are produced for sale at prices that are “economically significant.”10 Thus, the current market price of the produced good or service provides a rational and viable basis for valuing this production. Output for own final use consists of goods and services that are retained by the owners of the enterprises that produced them. Such output includes food produced on farms for own consumption, special tools produced by engineering firms for own use, and specialized software developed or improved in-house rather than purchasing custom- made software from a software development company. Goods or services produced for own final use are valued at the market prices of similar products or by their costs of production.11 Nonmarket output consists of goods and of individual or collective services that are produced by nonprofit institutions and by government that are supplied for free or at prices that are not economically significant. Individual services, such as education and health services, are provided at below-market prices as a matter of social or economic policy. Collective services, such as maintenance of law and order and protection of the environment, are provided for the benefit of the public as a whole and are financed out of funds other than receipts from sales. The values of the nonmarket output of nonprofits and of government are estimated based on the costs of production.12 9 For more information, see “Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: Changes in Definitions and Presentations,” Survey 93 (March 2013): 13–39. 10 Prices are “economically significant” when they have a significant influence on the amounts the producers are willing to supply and on the amounts the purchasers are willing to buy; see SNA 2008: 6.95. 11 See SNA 2008: 6.114, 6.124–6.125. 12 See SNA 2008: 6.128–6.129.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-5 In the NIPAs, a number of imputations for own-use and nonmarket transactions are made in order to include in the accounts the value of certain goods and services that have no observable price and are often not associated with any observable transaction.13 Additionally, imputations keep the accounts invariant to how certain activities are carried out (for example, an employee may be paid either in cash or in kind).14 Both a measure of production and the incomes associated with that production are imputed (for example, the imputation for food furnished to employees is included in PCE and in personal income). The largest NIPA imputation is that made to approximate the value of the services provided by owner-occupied housing. This imputation is made so that the treatment of owner-occupied housing in the accounts is comparable to that for tenant-occupied housing (which is valued by rent paid), thereby keeping GDP invariant as to whether a house is owned or rented. In the NIPAs, the purchase of a new house (excluding the value of the unimproved land) is treated as an investment, the ownership of the home is treated as a productive enterprise, and a service is assumed to flow, over its economic life, from the house to the occupant. For the homeowner, the value of this service is measured as the income the homeowner could have received if the house had been rented to a tenant. Another large imputation is that made to account for services (such as checking- account maintenance and loan services to borrowers) provided by banks and other financial institutions either without charge or for a small fee that does not reflect the entire value of the service. For the depositor, this “imputed interest” is measured as the difference between the interest paid by the bank and the interest that the depositor could have earned by investing in “safe” government securities (referred to as the “reference rate”). For the borrower, it is measured as the difference between the interest charged by the bank and the interest the bank could have earned by investing in those government securities.15 Geographic coverage Another important consideration is the geographic boundary that defines what is included in the accounts. In the NIPAs, and in the industry accounts, the “U.S. estimates” cover the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. military installations, embassies, 13 The SNA reserves the term “imputation” for situations in which a transaction must be “constructed” as well as “valued.” See SNA 2008: 3.75. 14 A complete list of the NIPA imputations was previously available in NIPA table 7.12, “Imputations in the National Income and Product Accounts,” which was discontinued in 2024. Previously published tables can be accessed in BEA’s Data Archive. 15 In the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA introduced improved methods for measuring the implicitly priced services provided by commercial banks (see Kyle K. Hood, “Measuring the Services of Commercial Banks in the National Income and Product Accounts: Changes in Concepts and Methods in the 2013 Comprehensive Revision,” Survey 93 (February 2013): 8–19). In the 2018 comprehensive update, these methods were also applied to credit unions and savings institutions; see Jason W. Chute, Stephanie H. McCulla, and Shelly Smith, “Preview of the 2018 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 98 (April 2018).",

This treatment aligns gross domestic product (GDP), the principal measure of U.S. production, with other U.S. statistics, such as population and employment. In BEA’s International Transactions Accounts (ITAs), the U.S. territories, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands are also treated as part of the domestic economy. This geographic difference between the two sets of accounts is reconciled through a “territorial adjustment.”16 In the NIPAs, a distinction is made between “domestic” measures and “national” measures. Domestic measures cover activities that take place within the geographic borders of the United States, while national measures cover activities that are attributable to U.S. residents.17 Thus, domestic measures are concerned with where an activity takes place, while national measures are concerned with to whom the activity is attributed. For example, GDP measures the market value of the goods, services, and structures produced within the nation's economy in a given period, while gross national product (GNP) measures the market value of the goods, services, and structures produced by labor and property supplied by U.S. residents. GNP is equal to GDP plus income receipts from the rest of the world less income payments to the rest of the world, and it is conceptually equivalent to gross national income (though it is estimated using different source data). Thus, for an assembly plant that is owned by a Japanese auto company and located in the United States, all of its output is included in GDP, but only the portion of the value that reflects U.S. residents’ labor and property is included in GNP. And, for an assembly plant that is owned by a U.S. auto company and located in Great Britain, none of its output is included in GDP, but the portion of the value that reflects U.S. residents’ labor or property is included in GNP. 16 See NIPA table 4.3C. “Relation of Foreign Transactions in the National Income and Product Accounts to the Corresponding Items in the International Transactions Accounts,” available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. Effective with the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA includes most transactions between the U.S. government and economic agents in Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands in federal government receipts and expenditures. Thus, like private transactions (such as trade in goods and services), government transactions with these areas are treated as transactions with the rest of the world. BEA’s long-run goal is to make the geographic coverage in the NIPAs consistent with that in the ITAs (see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, 10-27). See also Christina D. Hovland-Battikha and Erin M. Ludlow, “Territorial Economic Accounts for American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,” Survey 98 (February 2018). 17 “U.S. residents” includes individuals, governments, business enterprises, trusts, associations, nonprofit institutions, and similar organizations that have the center of their economic interest in the United States and that reside or expect to reside in the United States for 1 year or more. (For example, business enterprises residing in the United States include U.S. affiliates of foreign companies.) In addition, U.S. residents include all U.S. citizens who reside outside the United States for less than 1 year and U.S. citizens residing abroad for 1 year or more who meet one of the following criteria: owners or employees of U.S. business enterprises who reside abroad to further the enterprises’ business and who intend to return within a reasonable period; U.S. government civilian and military employees and members of their immediate families; and students who attend foreign educational institutions.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-7 Income and saving Some economic theorists have broadly defined income as the maximum amount that a household, or other economic unit, can consume without reducing its net worth; saving is then defined as the actual change in net worth.18 In the NIPAs, the definition of income is narrower, reflecting the goal of measuring current production. That is, the NIPA aggregate measures of current income—gross domestic income (GDI) for example—are viewed as arising from current production, and thus they are theoretically equal to their production counterparts (GDI equals GDP). NIPA saving is measured as the portion of current income that is set aside rather than spent on consumption or related purposes. Consequently, the NIPA measures of income and saving exclude the following items that affect net worth but are not directly associated with current production: • Capital gains or losses, or holding gains (or losses), which reflect changes in the prices of existing assets and thus do not represent changes in the real stock of produced assets; • Capital transfers, which reflect changes in the ownership of existing assets; and • Events, such as natural disasters, that result in changes in the real stock of existing assets but do not reflect an economic transaction. Thus, for example, the NIPA estimate of personal income includes ordinary dividends paid to stockholders, but it excludes the capital gains that accrue to those stockholders as a result of rising stock prices. Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.19 GDP and Other Major NIPA Measures Three ways to measure GDP In the NIPAs, GDP is defined as the market value of the goods, services, and structures produced by the economy in a given period. Conceptually, this measure can be arrived at by three separate means: as the sum of goods and services sold to final users, as the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services, and as the sum of the value added at each stage of production (figure 2.1). Although these three ways of measuring GDP are conceptually the same, their calculation may not result in identical estimates of GDP because of differences in data sources, timing, and estimation techniques. 18 Other theorists have limited this definition to expected income, a definition that would include regular capital gains but would exclude an unexpected windfall, such as a jackpot lottery payoff. 19 See “Alternative Measures of Personal Saving,” Survey 92 (March 2012): 23–26.",

As the sum of goods and services sold to final users This measure, known as the expenditures approach, is used to identify the goods and services purchased by persons, businesses, governments, and foreigners. It is calculated by summing the following final expenditures components. • Personal consumption expenditures, which measures the value of the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, persons—that is, households, nonprofit institutions that primarily serve households, private noninsured welfare funds, and private trust funds. • Gross private fixed investment, which measures additions and replacements to the stock of private fixed assets without deduction of depreciation. Nonresidential fixed investment measures investment by businesses and nonprofit institutions in nonresidential structures, equipment, and intellectual property products. Residential fixed investment measures investment by businesses and households in residential structures and equipment, primarily new construction of single- family and multifamily units. • Change in private inventories, which measures the value of the change in the physical volume of inventories owned by private business over a specified period, valued in the average prices of that period. • Net exports of goods and services, which is calculated as exports less imports. Exports consist of goods and services that are sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by U.S. residents to foreign residents. Imports consist of goods and services that are sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by foreign residents to U.S. residents. • Government consumption expenditures and gross investment, which comprises two components. Current consumption expenditures consists of the spending by general government in order to produce and provide goods and services to the public. Gross investment consists of spending by both general government and government enterprises for fixed assets (structures, equipment, and intellectual property products) that benefit the public or that assist government agencies in their productive activities.",

In this calculation, imports offset the non-U.S. production that is included in the other final- expenditure components. For example, PCE includes expenditures on imported cars as well as on domestically produced cars; thus, in order to properly measure domestic production, the sales of foreign-produced cars that are included in PCE are offset by a comparable entry in the imports of these cars.20 2. As the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services 20 The offset covers the foreign-produced portion of the value of these sales; the domestic value-added (such as the margin provided by domestic dealerships) on imported cars is measured by the difference between the two and is included in GDP.

    "text": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-10 This measure, known as the income approach, is used to examine the purchasing power of households and the financial status of businesses. The aggregate measure, referred to as GDI, is derived by summing the following components. • Compensation of employees, which is the total remuneration of employees in return for their work. It consists of wages and salaries (primarily the monetary remuneration of employees) and supplements (employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance). • Taxes on production and imports, which consist of taxes payable on products when they are produced, delivered, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by their producers (including federal excise taxes, custom duties, and state and local sales taxes) and of other taxes on production, such as taxes on ownership of assets used in production (including local real estate taxes). These taxes do not include taxes on income. • Subsidies, which are subtracted in the calculation of GDI, are payments by government agencies to private business (for example, federal subsidies to farmers) and to government enterprises (for example, federal subsidies to state and local public housing authorities) to support their current operations. • Net operating surplus, which is a profits-like measure that shows the incomes earned by private and government enterprises from current production before deducting any explicit or implicit interest charges, rent, or other property incomes payable on financial assets, land, or other natural resources required to carry out production. Net operating surplus plus consumption of fixed capital is equal to gross operating surplus. • Consumption of fixed capital, which is the NIPA measure of economic depreciation—that is, the decline in the value of the stock of assets due to physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event.21 Thus, GDI is equal to compensation of employees, plus taxes on production and imports less subsidies, plus net operating surplus, plus consumption of fixed capital. Subsidies are implicitly included in the measure of net operating surplus, but because they do not represent incomes paid or costs incurred in domestic production, they must be subtracted in calculating GDI. In the NIPAs, subsidies are shown as a subtraction from “taxes on imports and production” because they are transfers from government to business and thus, in effect, represent a negative tax by government. 3. As the sum of “value added” by all industries in the economy This measure, known as the value-added, or production, approach, is used to analyze the industrial composition of U.S. output. In the input-output (I-O) accounts, value added is defined as the difference between an industry’s gross output (sales or 21 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of disasters in which the value of irreparable damage to, or the destruction of, fixed assets is no longer recorded as consumption of fixed capital; see Eugene P.

When value added is aggregated across all industries in the economy, it is equal to GDP measured using the expenditures and income approaches.22 The I-O accounts focus on gross output because they are designed to measure the productive activities and interrelationships of all industries, regardless of whether the goods and services produced by these industries are for intermediate or for final use. Thus, gross output is sometimes referred to as “gross duplicated domestic output,” because it double counts the industry output that is purchased by other industries and used as inputs for their production. Because GDP counts only industry sales to final users, it is sometimes referred to as a “nonduplicative” measure of production in the economy. To illustrate, a new car shipped from an auto assembly plant reflects not only the costs and profit associated with final assembly but also the costs and profit associated with all of the stages of production that preceded final assembly. At an earlier stage, the tires that were put on that car were recorded as output of the tire plant and reflected the costs and profit associated with their manufacture. Thus, in gross output, the value of the tires is counted twice—once in the value of the auto manufacturer’s output and once in the value of the tire manufacturer’s output. Further, including the value of the rubber and metal that were shipped to the tire plant would constitute triple counting, and so on. In contrast, in the measurement of auto-industry value added, the value of the tires shipped to the assembly plant represents an intermediate input and so is subtracted from the value of the shipments of completed cars from the assembly plant. Because the nation’s total value added is equal to its GDP and the nation’s total gross output is equal to its GDP plus its total intermediate inputs, total gross output is much larger than GDP. For example, in the 2017 benchmark year, U.S. gross output was $34.5 trillion, while GDP was $19.6 trillion. Major NIPA aggregates In the NIPAs, the measure of domestic production that is derived as the sum of the final expenditures components is referred to as GDP, and the measure that is derived as the sum of the income payments and the costs incurred in production is referred to as GDI. These two measures and their components make up the “Domestic Income and Product Account,” the first of the summary NIPA accounts (see the section “Accounting Framework”). In general, the source data for the expenditures components are considered 22 In the I-O accounts, “all industries” includes government industries (such as the U. S. Postal Service) and certain “special industries” (such as owner-occupied housing).",

Figure 2.2 illustrates the relationships between GDP, GDI, and several other important aggregate NIPA measures. These measures are distinguished by whether they are “product” or “income,” “gross” or “net,” and “domestic” or “national.” In general, one moves: • from a “product” measure to an “income” measure by subtracting the statistical discrepancy, • from a “gross” measure to a “net” measure by subtracting consumption of fixed capital (CFC), and • from a “domestic” measure to a “national” measure by subtracting net income payments to the rest of the world (or equivalently, by adding net income receipts from the rest of the world).25 23 See Dylan G.

Although many technical problems arise in preparing these estimates, measuring the change in current-dollar GDP from one period to the next is conceptually straightforward, because it is the actual change in spending that occurs in the economy between the two time periods. For many analyses, it is useful to separate the changes in current-dollar GDP that are due to changes in quantity from those that are due to changes in price.30 However, aggregate quantity change and aggregate price change cannot be observed directly in the economy. Instead, these changes must be calculated, and the calculation method is determined by analytic requirements. In the NIPAs, the changes in quantities and prices are computed from chain-type indexes that are calculated using a Fisher formula. (For a discussion of the statistical methods used to prepare these measures, see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods.”) In the NIPAs, the featured measure of growth in the U.S. economy is the percent change in real GDP—that is, the quantity-change measure for GDP from one period to another.31 Thus, changes in real GDP provide a comprehensive measure of economic growth that is free of the effects of price change. In the NIPAs, the featured measure of inflation in the U.S. economy is the percent change in the price index for gross domestic purchases. This index measures the prices of goods and services purchased by U.S. residents, regardless of where the goods and services were produced. It is derived from the prices of PCE, gross private domestic investment, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. Thus, for example, an increase in the import price of a foreign-produced car would raise the prices paid by U.S. residents and thereby directly affect the price index for gross domestic purchases.32 29 This measure was introduced as part of the 2015 annual update of the NIPAs; see Stephanie McCulla and Shelly Smith, “Preview of the 2015 Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 95 (June 2015): 1-8. 30 In this separation, changes in the quality of the goods and services provided are treated as changes in quantity; BEA uses quality-adjusted price indexes to deflate goods and services to yield quantity estimates; these indexes are described in the appendix to Chapter 4: Estimating Methods. 31 Until 1991, GNP was the featured measure of U.S. production; see “Gross Domestic Product as a Measure of U.S. Production,” Survey 71 (August 1991): 8. 32 This example assumes the entire price increase is passed on to the car buyer—that is, the wholesale or retail margins are unchanged.",

  "34": {
    "text": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-16 Another aggregate price measure is the GDP price index, which measures the prices of goods and services produced in the United States. In contrast to the price index for gross domestic purchases, the GDP price index would not be directly affected by an increase in the import price of a foreign-built car, because imports are not included in GDP. Another important NIPA price measure is the PCE price index, which measures the prices paid for the goods and services purchased by “persons.” This index is frequently compared with the consumer price index, which is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The two indexes are similar, but there are differences in terms of coverage, weighting, and calculation.33 Further, BEA provides variants of the above price indexes that exclude their particularly volatile food and energy components; for the PCE price index, there are also variants that also exclude housing.34 These variants are sometimes used to indicate the “core inflation” in the U.S. economy. BEA publishes several aggregate measures of real income as counterparts to its aggregate measures of real production. Real GDI is calculated as current-dollar GDI deflated by the implicit price deflator (IPD) for GDP; real GNI is calculated as current- dollar GNI deflated by the IPD for GNP; and real net domestic income is calculated as current-dollar net domestic income deflated by the IPD for net domestic product.35 In addition, BEA prepares alternative measures of real GDP and real GNP that measure the real purchasing power of the income generated from the production of the goods and services by the U.S. economy. These measures, which in the NIPAs are called command-basis GDP and command-basis GNP, reflect the impact of changes in the terms of trade as well as changes in production (BEA also prepares alternative command- basis measures of NNP and NDP).36 In calculating command-basis GDP, exports and imports of goods and services are each deflated by the price index for gross domestic purchases to yield exports on a command-basis and imports on a command basis; then, command-basis exports are added to, and command-basis imports are subtracted from, real gross domestic purchases.37 The calculation of command-basis GNP is the same, except income receipts from the rest of the world are deflated along with exports, and 33 See Clinton P. McCully, Brian C. Moyer, and Kenneth J. Stewart, “Comparing the Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index,” Survey 87 (November 2007): 26–33. 34 Price indexes for PCE excluding food, energy, and housing and for PCE services excluding energy and housing were introduced as part of the 2023 comprehensive update of the National Economic Accounts. See Lisa S. Mataloni, Dorian L. Turner, and Stephanie H. McCulla, “The 2023 Comprehensive Update of the National Economic Accounts,” Survey 103 (November 2023). 35 Implicit price deflators for an aggregate or component are calculated as the ratio of the current-dollar value to the corresponding chained-dollar value, multiplied by 100 (see the section “Chained-dollar measures” in Chapter 4). 36 In the SNA, these measures are referred to as real GDI and real GNI. However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, BEA uses a different method to derive those aggregates. 37 In this case, adding and subtracting these estimates is acceptable because all three aggregates are derived using the same deflator.",

Thus, the command- basis measures are alternative measures of real GDP and real GNP that reflect the prices of purchased goods and services, while the primary measures of real GDP and real GNP reflect the prices of produced goods and services. BEA also prepares several measures that show the relationship between the prices that are received by U.S. producers and the prices that are paid by U.S. purchasers. The broadest measure, the trading gains index, is the ratio of the GDP price index to the price index for gross domestic purchases. An increase (decrease) in this ratio would indicate an increase (decrease) in the purchasing power of the income generated in producing GDP. Successively narrower measures specifically focus on the relationship between the prices of the U.S. goods and services that are produced for consumption by the rest of the world and the prices of the goods and services that are produced by the rest of the world for U.S. consumption. The terms of trade index, is the ratio of the price index for exports of goods and services to the price index for imports of goods and services; ratios for the terms of trade in goods and in nonpetroleum goods are also prepared. Movements in these trading indexes reflect the interaction of several factors—including movements in exchange rates, changes in the composition of traded goods and services, and changes in producers’ profit margins. In addition, BEA provides statistical measures that supplement the current-dollar, quantity-index, and price-index measures. Foremost among these are measures of the contributions of major components to the percent change from the preceding year or quarter in real GDP, in other principal product-side aggregates, in GDP prices, and in gross domestic purchases prices. BEA also provides measures of the percentage shares of current-dollar GDP and GDI that are accounted for by their major components. Classification The application of common classification systems for the NIPAs, and for all of the U.S. economic accounts, is extremely important because classification provides the structure necessary to prepare and present the estimates uniformly and consistently. Further, common classifications enable users to effectively compare and analyze data across the broad spectrum of economic statistics. 38 This methodology for calculating the command-basis aggregates was introduced in the 2010 annual update of the NIPAs; see Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, “Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 90 (August 2010): 21. For additional technical and historical background, see Marshall B.

Sector The NIPAs have a “mixed” sectoring scheme under which certain entities are defined one way for production related measures and another way for income-related measures39. For measuring domestic production in the NIPAs, the contribution, or value added, of various institutions can be broken down into three distinct groups, or sectors— business, households and institutions, and general government (table 2.1). A fourth sector, referred to as “the rest-of-the-world,” covers transactions between U. S. residents and foreign residents. Table 2.1—Gross Value Added by Sector Gross domestic product Business Nonfarm Farm Households and institutions Households Nonprofit institutions serving households General government Federal State and local Note. Adapted from NIPA table 1.3.1.

These other entities include mutual financial institutions, noninsured pension funds, cooperatives, nonprofit organizations (that is, entities classified as nonprofit by the Internal Revenue Service in determining income tax liability) that primarily serve business, federal reserve banks, federally sponsored credit agencies, and government enterprises.

The gross value added of households is measured by the services of owner-occupied housing and the compensation paid to domestic workers. The gross value added of NPISHs is measured by the compensation paid to the employees of these institutions, the rental value of fixed assets owned and used by these institutions, and the rental income of persons for tenant-occupied housing owned by these institutions.41 General government: The general government sector comprises all federal government and state and local government agencies except government enterprises. The gross value added of general government is measured as the sum of the compensation of the employees of these agencies and of their consumption of fixed capital. For measuring domestic income, outlays, and saving, institutions are grouped into three other sectors—personal, government, and corporate (along with the fourth “rest of world” sector for limited measures of transactions in income). Personal: The personal sector comprises households (families and unrelated individuals) and private unincorporated enterprises—that is, sole proprietorships, partnerships, and other private businesses, such as tax-exempt cooperatives.42 Government: The government sector comprises both general government and government agencies; while the production of the enterprises is included in the business sector, their surplus or deficit as well as their interest payments and receipts and their investments are included in the government sector. Estimates of most transactions between government enterprises and their general government owners are not provided. Corporate: The corporate sector comprises only corporate businesses that are organized for profit; government enterprises and unincorporated businesses are classified in the household sector and government sector, respectively.

Industry The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the official industry classification system for the United States.48 NAICS was developed during the 1990s through a collaborative effort by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to facilitate better comparisons of the economies of the three countries.49 Prior to the adoption of NAICS, most U.S. statistics were based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).50 The SIC system, which was initially developed in the late 1930s, was concentrated in manufacturing, which dominated the U.S. economy at that time. The switch from the SIC to NAICS provided more detailed classifications for services industries and for high-tech industries. Moreover, by organizing establishments based on their production methods rather than on the products they produced, NAICS provided a better conceptual basis for industrial classification. NAICS was introduced into the national economic accounts in late 2002 with the release of the 1997 benchmark I-O accounts, which were based on the 1997 Economic Census. Effective with the 2003 comprehensive update, NAICS became the industry classification system for the NIPAs. In the NIPAs, industrial distributions are presented for national income and most of its components, capital consumption allowances, employment and hours, and the change in private inventories and the stock of private inventories (see, for example, table 2.5 below).51 For income and employment, the classification of the estimates for 1998 forward is based on NAICS; for inventories, the classification of the estimates for the first quarter of 1997 forward is based on NAICS. In general, the estimates by industry before these dates are on a SIC basis.52 48 See North American Industry Classification System, United States, available on the Census Bureau website at www.census.gov/naics/. 49 For information of the development and implementation of NAICS, see John Kort, “The North American Industry Classification System in BEA’s Accounts,” Survey 81 (May 2001): 7–13. 50 See Office of Management and Budget, Statistical Policy Division, Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), 1988); Office of Management and Budget, Statistical Policy Division, Standard Industrial Classification Manual,1972 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1972); and Bureau of the Budget, Standard Industrial Classification Manual,1942 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1942). 51 An industrial distribution of fixed investment based on data collected from establishments is prepared as part of the procedure used to estimate fixed assets. For further information, see “Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, for 1925–97,” September 2007 on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 52 NAICS-based estimates for GDP by industry and for fixed assets are available for earlier periods.",

Adapted from NIPA table 6.1D. The industrial distributions for wages and salaries and for inventories are generally based on data collected from “establishments,” while those for the other NIPA components are generally based on data collected from “companies” (also called “enterprises,” or “firms”). Companies consist of one or more establishments owned by the same legal entity or group of affiliated entities. Establishments are economic units, generally at a single physical location, where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed (for example a factory, mill, store, hotel, movie theater, mine, farm, airline terminal, sales office, warehouse, or central administrative office). Establishments are classified into an industry on the basis of their principal production method, and companies are classified into an industry on the basis of the principal industry of all their establishments. Because large multi-establishment companies typically contain establishments that are classified in different industries, the industrial distribution of the same economic activity on an establishment basis can differ significantly from that on a company basis. For example, the measure of corporate profits by steel-manufacturing companies will include the profits of establishments that do not manufacture steel but are part of companies that are classified as steel-manufacturing",

Similarly, this measure will exclude the profits of establishments that manufacture steel but are part of companies that are not classified as steel-manufacturing companies. Moreover, individual industry series are not fully comparable over time. First, the composition of industries may change because of revisions to NAICS or to the SIC. This factor affects estimates based on establishment data and on company data. Second, historical comparability may be affected by a change over time in the industrial classification of the same establishment or company. For example, the classification of a company may change as a result of shifts in the level of consolidation of entities for which company reports are filed or as a result of mergers and acquisitions. This factor affects company-based estimates much more than establishment-based estimates. As noted above, there is a break in 1998 between SIC and NAICS classifications for NIPA estimates of income and employment and in 1997 for NIPA estimates of inventories. Moreover, while the NAICS-based NIPA estimates are periodically updated to reflect the most recent NAICS categories (currently 2012), the estimates are bridged to, and largely presented on, the 1997 NAICS structure to avoid repeated changes to the NIPA presentation. In addition, some NIPA tables show the following special industry groupings: Financial industries consists of the NAICS industry “Finance and insurance” and of “Offices of bank holding companies” and “Offices of other holding companies” in the NAICS industry “Management of companies and enterprises.” Finance and insurance consists of Federal Reserve banks; credit intermediation and related activities; securities, commodity contracts, and investments; insurance carriers and related activities; and funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles. Nonfinancial industries consists of all other private industries. Private goods-producing industries consists of the following NAICS industry groups: agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; and manufacturing. Private services-producing industries consists of the following NAICS industry groups: utilities; wholesale trade; retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; finance and insurance; real estate and rental and leasing; professional, scientific, and technical services; management of companies and enterprises; administrative and waste management services; educational services; health care and social assistance; arts, entertainment, and recreation; accommodation and food services; and other services, except government.",

Table 2.6—National Income by Legal Form of Organization National income Domestic business Corporate business Noncorporate business Sole proprietorships and partnerships Other private business Government enterprises Households and institutions General government Rest of the world Note. Adapted from NIPA table 1.13. Corporate business: This legal form comprises all entities required to file federal corporate tax returns, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1120 series. It includes mutual financial institutions and cooperatives subject to federal income tax, private noninsured pension funds, nonprofit institutions that primarily serve business, Federal Reserve banks, and federally sponsored credit agencies. Sole proprietorships: This legal form comprises all entities that are required to file IRS Schedule C (Profits or Loss from Business) or Schedule F (Farm Income and Expenses) or that would be required to file if the proprietor met the filing requirements. Partnerships: This legal form comprises all entities that are (or would be) required to file federal partnership income tax returns, IRS Form 1065 (U.S. Partnership Return of Income). Other private business: This legal form comprises (1) all entities that are (or would be) required to report rental and royalty income on IRS Schedule E (Supplemental Income and Loss) of the individual income tax return and (2) tax-exempt cooperatives. Government enterprises: This legal form consists of government agencies that cover a substantial proportion of their operating costs by selling goods and services to the public and that maintain their own separate accounts. For example, the U.S. Postal Service is a federal government enterprise, and public water and sewage agencies are local government enterprises.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-26 Accounting Framework The NIPAs consist of a set of integrated accounts that provide statistics on the output of the U.S. economy. The NIPA accounting framework is designed to provide context for these statistics, so that they are presented logically, consistently, and according to established economic-accounting principles and standards. The NIPAs are generally consistent with the SNA, which now serves as the internationally accepted set of guidelines for the compilation of national accounts.53 For an in-depth discussion of the conceptual framework of the NIPAs and the NIPA summary accounts and of the underlying accounting principles and common financial statements, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, An Introduction to the National Income and Product Accounts, Methodology Paper No. 1 (updated), September 2007.54 The seven summary accounts and the definitions of the line items they include at make up the seven summary accounts are presented in the appendix to this Handbook, “Summary National Income and Product Accounts.” Accounting principles Double-entry bookkeeping is one of the most fundamental principles used in economic accounting and in financial accounting. In financial accounting, activities that affect the resources available to a business are recorded at least once as a source of financing (credit) and at least once as a use of financing (debit). Thus, double-entry bookkeeping provides a means to validate the accounting entries, because the sum of the entries on each side of an account must be equal. In national economic accounting, each transaction is recorded as a payment by one sector and as a receipt by the same sector or by another sector—for example corporate income tax is a payment by a corporation and a receipt of the government.55 In addition to providing a means to validate entries, this system also provides alternative ways to calculate a measure when complete information is not available for one of the sectors. The accrual-accounting method is another principle important to both financial and economic accounting. This method is generally used to ensure that related revenues and expenses are recorded in the same accounting period. In accrual accounting, revenues are recorded when they are earned, and expenses are recorded when they are incurred, 53 See Stephanie H. McCulla, Karin E. Moses, and Brent R. Moulton, “The National Income and Product Accounts and the System of National Accounts 2008: Comparison and Research Plans,” Survey 95 (June 2015): 1-17, and see Charles Ian Mead, Karin E. Moses, and Brent R. Moulton, “The NIPAs and the System of National Accounts,” Survey 84 (December 2004): 17–32. 54 “An Introduction to the National Income and Product Accounts,” available at www.bea.gov. 55 A fully articulated set of national accounts (showing payments and receipts by all sectors) actually leads to a quadruple-entry system (in which each transaction is recorded as a debit and a change in assets for one sector and as a credit and a change in assets for another sector). However, transactions are usually recorded only twice in the NIPAs because the changes in assets or liabilities that are associated with the changes in revenues or expenses are recorded in the Federal Reserve Board’s flow of funds accounts.",

The accrual-accounting method may be contrasted to the cash-accounting method, which records revenues when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. Financial accounting and economic accounting generally apply different principles in valuing transactions. In financial accounting, assets (and depreciation) are commonly valued at historical costs—that is, at the prices relevant at the time of the acquisition; subsequent changes in the value of these assets are ignored. In economic accounting, assets (and depreciation) are valued at current costs—that is, at the market prices that prevail at the time they are valued. In preparing the NIPAs, various adjustments, such as the inventory valuation adjustment and the capital consumption adjustment, are made so that the estimates will reflect current costs rather than historical costs. Conceptual derivation of the NIPAs The NIPAs represent consolidations of the production, the income and outlay, and the saving and investment accounts for each sector of the economy (business, households, government, and foreign). These sector accounts, in turn, represent aggregations of the accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy, regardless of whether formal accounting statements exist explicitly for all of them. Specifically, for each sector, the production account records the value of the production that is attributable to that sector and the uses of the income arising from that production. The income and outlay account records the sources of the sector’s income, its current outlays, and its saving. The saving and investment account (also known as the capital account) records the sector’s gross saving and gross investment, where gross investment is net acquisitions of assets less net increase in liabilities. Figure 2.3 illustrates the relationship between the summary NIPAs and the underlying production, income and outlay, and saving and investment accounts for the sectors of the economy.",

Income and outlays for the personal sector, including income accruing to unincorporated businesses, are shown in the “personal income and outlay account.” Income and outlays for the government sector, including income accruing to government enterprises, are shown in the “government current receipts and expenditures account. Income and outlays for business enterprises and for households and institutions in their role as producers are shown in the “private enterprise income account.” In order to provide analytically useful aggregates associated with all private business, the coverage in this account includes the income and outlays of unincorporated businesses as well as those of corporate businesses. The saving and investment accounts are consolidated into a single summary “domestic capital account.” For saving, a breakdown by sector is shown for corporate, personal, and government saving. For investment, because of source data limitations, the breakdown is shown for private fixed and inventory investment and for government fixed investment. The transactions for the foreign (or rest-of-the-world) “sector”—that is, transactions between U.S. residents and foreign residents—are shown separately in two summary accounts.

    "text": "CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 2-29 The summary NIPAs The seven summary NIPAs constitute the accounting framework for presenting the value of production, distribution, consumption, and saving for the U.S. economy.56 (For definitions of all of the line entries in these tables, and to see the tables themselves, see the appendix to this handbook.) Each of the entries in a summary account also appears again in that account or in one of the other summary accounts; most of these entries are also shown in one or more of the tables that make up the full set of NIPA tables. For example, the item “supplements to wages and salaries” is shown in line 5 of summary account 1 and in line 14 of summary account 3; it is also shown in line 8 of NIPA table 1.10 and in line 6 of NIPA table 2.1. Taken together, the summary accounts constitute a double-entry system in which a use (or expenditure) recorded in one account for one sector is also recorded as a source (or receipt) in an account of another sector or of the same sector. This system of integrated, double-entry accounts provides a comprehensive measure of economic activity in a consistently defined framework without double-counting. Thus, the NIPAs, in combination with BEA’s industry, wealth, and other economic accounts, can be used to trace the principal economic flows among the major sectors of the economy. Account 1: Domestic Income and Product Account This account represents an aggregation of the underlying production accounts for the domestic sectors of the U.S. economy. The right (product) side of the account shows GDP measured as the sum of goods and services sold to final users rather than as the sum of value-added by the sectors. The left (income) side of the account shows GDP as measured by the incomes earned in production—GDI—plus the “statistical discrepancy” (the difference between GDP and GDI). Product and income are both presented on a domestic basis—that is, they are produced by labor and property located in the United States. Account 2: Private Enterprise Income Account This account presents information on the sources and uses of the income of private businesses and other private enterprises.57 It combines the accounts of private businesses, of homeowners for owner-occupied housing (which is treated as if it were a business), and of NPISHs. 56 Prior to the 2003 comprehensive update, the NIPAs were summarized in five accounts, as shown in Table A on pages 38–39 of the August 2002 Survey. For a discussion of the differences between the old and new summary accounts, see Nicole Mayerhauser, Shelly Smith, and David F. Sullivan, “Preview of the 2003 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: New and Redesigned Tables,” Survey 83 (August 2003): 8–15. 57 Government enterprises are not included in account 2, because complete estimates on sources and uses of government enterprise income, notably the income payments and income receipts on assets, are not currently available. The sources and uses of government enterprise income are included, but not separately identified, in the government receipts and expenditures account.",

Corporate profits, a widely used measure in the United States, is distributed to government (taxes on corporate income) and to shareholders (net dividends) or is retained (undistributed profits, which can be thought of as a measure of corporate saving). Account 3: Personal Income and Outlay Account This account shows the sources and uses of income received by persons—that is, households, NPISHs, private noninsured welfare funds, and private trust funds. The right side of the account shows the sources of personal income—such as employee compensation and interest and dividend income. The left side shows personal taxes and outlays and personal saving, which is derived as personal income minus personal taxes and outlays. Account 4: Government Receipts and Expenditures Account This account summarizes the combined transactions of the federal government and of the state and local governments. The right side of the account shows government current receipts—such as tax receipts from persons and contributions for government social insurance. The left side shows government current expenditures—such as compensation of government employees and transfer payments to persons—and net saving, which is derived as current receipts less current expenditures. Account 5: Foreign Transactions Current Account This account summarizes all the current transactions between the United States and the rest of the world. It presents information on receipts and payments associated with foreign trade, income receipts and payments, and current taxes and other transfer payments. This account does not include transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of nonproduced nonfinancial assets nor capital transfers, which are shown in the foreign transactions capital account, nor does it include transactions in financial assets and liabilities. The left side of this account shows current receipts from the rest of the world—mainly exports of goods and services, income receipts on assets, and current taxes, contributions for government social insurance, and transfer receipts from the rest of the world. The right side shows current payments to the rest of the world—mainly imports of goods and services, income payments on assets, and current taxes and transfer 58 Summary account 2 presents the components of private enterprise income on a national basis—that is, for income accruing to U.S. residents.

Given the theoretical equality between GDP and GDI, the statistical discrepancy can be viewed as actual (positive or negative) income that is not captured by the data used to measure GDI and, therefore, not distributed to the sectors; instead, it is shown as a source of (positive or negative) saving in this account. The left side of the account shows gross domestic investment, capital-account transactions (net), and net lending or net borrowing, which is derived as gross saving and the statistical discrepancy minus gross domestic investment and capital-account transactions (net).

The interaction of source data and estimating methods determines the accuracy, reliability, and relevancy of the accounts. The data that BEA uses are collected from a variety of sources and are usually collected for purposes other than for incorporation into BEA's estimates. Data collected by federal government agencies provide the backbone of the estimates; these data are supplemented by data from trade associations, businesses, international organizations, and other sources. The Government data are from a number of agencies, including the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Treasury Department, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Agriculture Department. “Administrative” data are data that are tabulated by federal government and by state and local government agencies as a byproduct of administering their programs—such as processing corporate tax returns, regulating public utilities, and issuing building permits. Examples of important administrative sources of data for the NIPAs include the Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income program, which provides data for a number of NIPA income estimates, the Budget of the United States Government from the Executive Office of the President, which is the major source of data for the NIPA estimates of federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment, the social insurance programs of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Social Security Administration, which provide data on health insurance and social security incomes, and the military payroll systems of the U.S. Department of Defense. “Statistical” data are data collected by the federal statistical agencies, such as the Census Bureau and BLS. These data consist of periodic economic and population censuses and a wide range of sample surveys, such as those that collect data on manufacturing and trade, employment, and prices. The relatively few surveys that BEA conducts cover international trade in services and international direct investment, both by foreign companies in the United States and by U.S. companies in foreign countries. The source data available to BEA are not always ideal for the preparation of the NIPAs. BEA must develop methods that transform the best available data into estimates that are consistent with the NIPA concepts and framework and that fill gaps in the coverage of the source data. (See “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods.”)",

    "text": "CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA 3-2 Source data as determinants of initial release and revision schedules The availability of the source data is an important consideration in determining the schedules for the initial release and the subsequent revisions of the NIPA estimates. One factor affecting availability is the speed with which the source data are collected, compiled, and released. Another factor is whether the source data are part of a statistical program that, over time, provides more complete or otherwise better coverage—for example, if the sample is larger or if more detailed information is collected for an annual survey than for the monthly surveys. In general, the most comprehensive source data for the expenditure components of gross domestic product (GDP) are available at the 5-year intervals associated with the Census Bureau’s Economic Census. The Economic Census is the most extensive collection of data related to business establishments and is the primary data source for BEA’s Input-Output Accounts, which are used to \"benchmark\" the NIPA estimates for the quinquennial census years. Related annual surveys are drawn from samples of the establishments covered in the Economic Census; these surveys generally collect less detailed data than those collected in the Economic Census. Many of the annual surveys are supplemented by monthly surveys that involve smaller samples and that collect less detailed data than the annual surveys.1 In addition, responding to the censuses and annual surveys is generally mandatory, while responding to most of the quarterly and monthly surveys is voluntary. The data from the monthly surveys are available first, and they provide much of the information that is used to prepare the initial, or “current,” quarterly (and for a few components, monthly) NIPA estimates. These estimates are subsequently revised as additional reports become available from the monthly surveys. Annual updates, which are timed to incorporate newly available annual source data, are usually carried out each fall. Comprehensive updates, which incorporate the most complete source data as well as other improvements to the accounts, are carried out at about 5-year intervals.2 Thus, revisions do not reflect errors. On the contrary, revisions are mainly driven by the incorporation of more complete and revised source data, and the release of the revised estimates is determined by the availability of these data. The source data used to prepare 1 Many of the annual and monthly surveys are based on “probability sampling” (sometimes known as “scientific sampling”). In this process, establishments are first placed into various “strata” on the basis of their size. Depending on the distribution of establishments, an establishment in the largest strata could have a 100-percent probability of selection and thus have a sampling weight of 1—that is, the establishment would represent only itself. An establishment in a smaller stratum would have a smaller probability of selection, say 1 percent, but in that case the establishment would have a sampling weight of 100—that is, the sampled establishment would represent 100 establishments. 2 Unless noted otherwise, annual data are presented on a calendar-year basis (i.e., covering January through December). Quarter data are also presented on a calendar basis (i.e., the first quarter (Q1) covers January, February, and March; Q2 covers April, May, and June; Q3 covers July, August, and September; and Q4 covers October, November, and December).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA 3-3 the estimates of GDP and gross domestic income (GDI) can be grouped into five general categories based on their quality, availability, and use.3 • Comprehensive data provide comprehensive or nearly comprehensive coverage of the relevant population. They are either consistent with the concepts, coverage, or timing underlying the national accounts, or they can be made consistent with only minor adjustments. • Adjusted comprehensive data provide comprehensive or nearly comprehensive coverage of the relevant population; however, these data require substantial adjustments in order to conform to the concepts underlying the national accounts. • Direct indicator data are used to indicate the movements of a series rather than the levels of a series; they are closely related to the comprehensive data that are ultimately incorporated into the estimates, but they are less detailed or do not provide comprehensive coverage of the relevant population. • Indirect indicator data are used to prepare indicator series when more suitable data are not available. They include volume or activity indicators and other NIPA estimates. • Trend-based data are used when no data are available; they are typically based on previous estimates, using moving averages, regressions, growth factors, or judgment. The following sections describe the most important federal government source data that are used for the current quarterly estimates and for the annual and comprehensive updates of the NIPAs. In the preparation of the estimates, these sources are augmented by a wealth of information from other public sources and from private sources, such as trade associations. Source data for the current quarterly estimates Data from Census Bureau monthly surveys are among the primary sources for the current quarterly estimates (table 3.1). For the most part, the samples for these voluntary surveys are drawn from the Economic Census, from the corresponding annual surveys, and from the Business Register; the samples are updated periodically to account for new businesses (“births”) and for businesses that discontinue operations (“deaths”).4 3 For more information, see Alyssa E. Holdren, “Gross Domestic Product and Gross Domestic Income: Revisions and Source Data,” Survey of Current Business 94 (June 2014): 1–11. 4 The Business Register is a comprehensive database of U.S. business establishments and companies that is maintained by the Census Bureau for statistical program use.

Data are collected on the value of shipments, on total inventories and inventories by stage of fabrication, and on new orders received and unfilled orders. These source data are primarily used in estimating investment in private equipment, change in private inventories, and nonfarm proprietors’ income. An advance report on durable-goods manufacturers’ shipments and orders is released about 3½–4 weeks after the close of the “reference” month.5 The composite M3 data are released about 5 weeks after the close of the reference month.

An advance report on monthly sales for retail and food services (MARTS) is released about 1½–2 weeks after the close of the reference month. The composite retail sales and inventories data are released about 6 weeks after the close of the reference month and are incorporated into BEA’s 2nd and 3rd estimates of GDP; the Census Bureau makes an advanced report on retail inventories available to BEA in time to incorporate the data into its advance GDP estimates. Quarterly Services Survey (QSS) is a Census Bureau sample survey that was initiated in 2003–2004 in order to improve the coverage of the service industries in the U.S. economy. The coverage of the QSS has since been expanded several times so that it now covers most of the categories of health care, transportation services, recreation services, communication services, and professional and other services.6 The QSS data are primarily used in estimating PCE and private investment in intellectual property products. The QSS data are released about 2½ months after the close of the reference quarter. The Census Bureau also makes advance QSS data available to BEA approximately 50 days following the end of each reference quarter, in time for the data to be incorporated into several PCE services estimates and estimates of private fixed investment in software as part of the second GDP release for each quarter. Monthly construction spending (value put-in-place) is a Census Bureau measure of the value of construction installed or erected during a given period. The data for private nonresidential buildings, for government structures, and for multifamily residential buildings are derived from data collected by sampling the owners of construction projects.7 The data for single-family residential buildings are derived indirectly using information collected in a series of sample surveys that track the number of housing-unit permits, starts, sales, and completions. The data for “other construction” are derived from a variety of sources covering farm, utility, communication, and railroad structures. These source data are primarily used in estimating private and government investment in structures. The data for construction put-in-place are released about 1 month after the close of the reference month. Monthly U.S. international trade in goods and services consist of Census Bureau estimates of trade in goods and BEA estimates of trade in services. The Census Bureau tabulations of exported and imported goods are from documents filed with Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; they cover all shipments above a certain size and a sample of the remaining shipments.

Thus, value put-in-place captures some important parts of construction activity that are not included in the census—such as nonemployer construction, architectural and engineering costs, own-account construction, homeowner construction, and construction done as a secondary source of revenue by nonconstruction establishments.",

The BEA estimates of trade in services are primarily based on 11 mandatory BEA surveys of selected services receipts, payments, and other data. These data are supplemented by a combination of monthly indicator source data, partial data from U.S. government agencies and from foreign central statistical offices and banks, and other secondary source data. These source data are primarily used in estimating private investment in equipment and in software and in estimating exports and imports. The U.S. international trade statistics are jointly released by the two agencies about 5 weeks after the close of the reference month. International Transactions Accounts (ITAs), prepared by BEA, summarize the quarterly transactions between the United States and the rest of the world. In the ITAs, the current account records exports and imports of goods and services, receipts and payments of income on assets, and unilateral transfers (net gifts to other countries). In the capital and financial account, the capital account records capital transfers (such as debt forgiveness) and the financial account records transactions involving exchanges of financial assets for other financial assets or for tangible resources and gifts or grants of financial assets. These source data are primarily used in estimating corporate profits. The ITAs are released about 2½ months after the close of the reference quarter. Annual projections and quarterly farm data, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, consist of annual projections of crop output, quarterly projections of cash receipts and of inventories for livestock, and annual projections of government subsidy payments and production expenses for both crops and livestock. These data are primarily used in estimating change in private inventories and farm proprietors’ income. Monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey is a sample survey of business establishments that is conducted by state employment security agencies in cooperation with BLS. The CES (also known as BLS-790) covers payroll employment in private nonagricultural industries during the pay period that includes the 12th of the month. The data collected include series for total employment, number of production or nonsupervisory workers, average hourly earnings, average weekly hours, average weekly earnings, and average weekly overtime hours in manufacturing industries. (BLS has developed experimental series that extend coverage to all employees and that include irregular payments, such as bonuses.) These source data are primarily used in estimating PCE, wages and salaries, and nonfarm proprietors’ income. The CES data are usually released on the first Friday following the close of the reference month. Quarterly Financial Report (QFR), prepared by the Census Bureau, provides aggregate statistics on the financial position of U.S. corporations. Based on a sample survey of firms above specified asset sizes, the QFR presents estimated statements of income and retained earnings, balance sheets, and related financial and operating ratios for manufacturing, mining, trade, and selected service corporations by industry and by asset size. These source data are primarily used in estimating corporate profits. The QFR statistics are released about 75 days after the end of the first, second, and third calendar quarters, and approximately 90 days after the end of the fourth calendar quarter..",

The MTS presents a summary of receipts and outlays, surplus or deficit, and means of financing. The data are provided by federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks. These source data are primarily used in estimating federal government receipts and expenditures and federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment. The MTS is usually released about 8 days after the close of the reference month. Consumer Price Index (CPI), prepared by BLS, is a family of indexes that measure the average monthly change in the prices paid by urban consumers for a fixed market basket of goods and services. The CPI covers “out-of-pocket” expenditures, including user fees (such as water and sewer service) and sales and excise taxes paid by the consumer but excluding income taxes and investment items (such as stocks, bonds, and life insurance). The CPI is estimated from a statistical set of samples of urban areas, of consumers within those areas, of retailers and other outlets, and of specific, unique items purchased. CPIs are primarily used in deflating PCE, change in private inventories, and state and local government purchases. The CPI is released 2–3 weeks after the close of the reference month. Producer Price Index (PPI), prepared by BLS, is a family of indexes that measure the average monthly change in prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. In 2014, BLS significantly expanded its current coverage of the United States economy to over 75 percent of in-scope domestic production. The expansion featured a transition from stage-of-processing to final demand-intermediate demand aggregation by incorporating PPIs for services, construction, government purchases, and exports.8 The PPI is estimated from data collected from a sample of establishments that participate in the Unemployment Insurance System, a joint federal and state program that covers about 97 percent of wage and salary workers. PPIs are primarily used in deflating private investment in structures and equipment, change in private inventories, government purchases, and exports and imports. The PPI is released about 2 weeks after the close of the reference month. International Price Indexes, prepared by BLS, measure monthly changes in the prices of goods and services that are sold by U.S. producers to foreign buyers (exports) and that are purchased from abroad by U.S. buyers (imports). The price indexes for exports of goods to Canada are based primarily on sampling information obtained from the Canadian Customs Service, and the indexes for exports of goods to other countries are based on sampling information obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. The price indexes for imports of goods are based on sampling information obtained from Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The price indexes for exports and imports of services are based on sampling information that is developed separately for each service category. These price indexes are primarily used in deflating 8 See “Producer Price Index Transitions from Stage-of-Processing to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand Aggregation System,” at https://www.bls.gov/.",

The International Price Indexes are released about 2 weeks after the close of the reference month. Estimating schedule For GDP and most other NIPA series, the estimates for each quarter are prepared on a schedule that calls for three successive \"current\" estimates—\"advance,\" \"second,\" and \"third.\"9 The specific release date for each month is primarily determined by the availability of the monthly reports on retail sales, manufacturing shipments, and international trade in goods from the Census Bureau (along with the time it takes BEA to process them). • The advance quarterly estimate of GDP is released near the end of the month that follows the close of the reference quarter. For most of the product-side components, the estimate is based on source data for either 2 or 3 months of the quarter. In most cases, however, the source data for the second and third months of the quarter are subject to revision by the issuing agencies. Where source data are not available, the estimate is based primarily on BEA projections. 10 • One month later, the advance estimate is replaced by the second estimate, which is typically based on source data for all 3 months of the quarter. However, in some instances, the source data used for the second estimate, particularly the data for the third month of the quarter, are subject to further revision. • One month later, the second estimate is replaced by the third estimate, which incorporates revisions to source data for the third month of the quarter and newly available quarterly source data for some components. For certain “income-side” series—gross national product, gross domestic income, national income, and corporate profits—“advance” estimates are not prepared, because of a lag in the availability of source data. For the first, second, and third quarters of the year, the release of the second GDP estimate presents the initial estimates for these income- side series, and the third GDP release presents revised estimates. For the fourth quarter, the estimates for these series are presented only in the third GDP release. In addition, when the second estimate of GDP for the current quarter is released, the preceding quarter’s estimates of private wages and salaries and affected income-side aggregates are revised to incorporate newly available preliminary tabulations from the 9 In the 2009 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA introduced new names for the second two vintages of the current quarterly estimates. Formerly, the “second” estimate was known as the “preliminary” estimate, and the “third” estimate” was known as the “final” estimate. The initial estimate continues to be named the “advance” estimate. (See Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, “Preview of the 2009 Comprehensive Revision of the NIPAs: Changes in Definitions and Presentations,” Survey 89 (March 2009): 19–20.) 10 A comprehensive table that presents the \"Key Source Data and Assumptions\" that are used to prepare each vintage of the estimate of GDP for the current quarter is available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov.",

Trend-based data account for 28 percent, and direct indicator data account for the remainder. (See figure 3.1 on the next page). For the advance GDP estimates, indirect indicator and trend-based data together account for almost two-thirds of the source data used to calculate the estimates; for the third estimate, the two together account for only one-third-.

For estimates of GDI, there is a slower progression from less-comprehensive to more-comprehensive source data. Indirect indicator data account for 56 percent of the source data used to calculate the estimates for both the second and third estimates (as noted above, there is no advanced estimate for GDI).

The NIPA estimates for all 3 years are revised to incorporate a broad range of newly available and revised annual source data (table 3.2).

The ASM data are published about 11 months after the close of the reference year. Annual Wholesale Trade Survey (AWTS) is a Census Bureau survey of companies that have significant activity in wholesale trade. These companies include wholesalers that take title of the goods they sell—such as jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and manufacturer sales branches and offices (MSBOs)—and, beginning in 2007, wholesalers that do not take title—such as agents, merchandise and commodity brokers, commission merchants, and electronic business-to-business marketers. Merchant wholesalers excluding MSBOs provide data on sales, inventories, inventory valuation, purchases, and gross margin. MSBOs provide data on sales, inventories, inventory valuation, and operating expenses. The wholesalers that do not take title provide data on sales, commissions earned, gross selling value of sales conducted for others, and operating expenses. The AWTS data are primarily used in estimating change in private inventories and nonfarm proprietors’ income. The statistics for all wholesalers are normally published about 15 months following the close of the reference year. Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS) is a Census Bureau survey of retail companies with one or more establishments that sell merchandise and associated services to final consumers. The survey is sent to a sample of retail establishments with paid employees, and the data collected are supplemented by administrative data to account for businesses without paid employees (typically self-employed individuals or unincorporated partnerships). The ARTS collects data on the dollar value of retail sales, sales taxes collected, inventories, inventory valuation, cost of purchases, and accounts receivables balances. These source data are primarily used in estimating PCE and change in private inventories. The statistics are normally published about 15 months following the close of the reference year. Service Annual Survey (SAS) is a Census Bureau survey of companies that provide services to individuals, businesses, and governments. The survey is sent to selected businesses with paid employees, and the data collected are supplemented by administrative data or imputed values to account for businesses without paid employees. The data collected include operating revenue for both taxable and tax-exempt firms and organizations, sources of revenue, exports, and inventories for selected industries, and selected industry-specific items. The SAS has been expanded over time in order to improve the coverage of the service industries in the U.S. economy.14 The SAS data are primarily used in estimating PCE and private investment in intellectual property products. The statistics are normally published about 12 months after the close of the reference year. 14 For a discussion of the most recent expansion of the SAS, see Eugene P. Seskin and Alyssa E.

The data are compiled from three sources: an enumeration of all 50 states, a probability sample survey of local governments, and data from federal government agencies. Reported data are for each government’s annual accounting period (fiscal year) that ends on or before June 30 of the survey year. Data are obtained for revenue, expenditure, debt, and financial assets. These source data are primarily used in estimating state and local government spending, employee compensation, and taxes on production and imports. The data are available about 12 months after the close of the survey year. Annual revision of the International Transactions Accounts (ITAs), prepared by BEA, incorporates newly available annual source data and statistical, methodological, and presentational improvements into the accounts, which may result in revisions that extend back for a number of years.15 (The ITAs were described in the preceding section on sources for the current quarterly estimates.) These source data are primarily used in estimating exports of goods and services, and imports of goods and services. The annual update of the ITAs is released in mid-June. Annual farm statistics are collected in the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), which is sponsored jointly by the Economic Research Service and the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ARMS starts in the fall with the collection of data on crop production and costs and finishes in the spring with the collection of data on whole farm and livestock production practices and costs. The data, which underpin USDA’s annual estimates of net farm income, cover virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture, including production and supplies, prices paid and received, farm labor and wages, and farm finances. These source data are primarily used in estimating change in private inventories and farm proprietors’ income. The ARMS data are available in the fall following the close of the reference year. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) is a cooperative program (also known as the ES-202 program) involving BLS and the state employment security agencies. The QCEW produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers who are covered by state unemployment insurance programs or by the unemployment insurance program for federal employees; as such, the QCEW is a virtual census of nonagricultural employment and wages. These source data are primarily used in estimating PCE, wages and salaries, and nonfarm proprietors’ income. The QCEW data are usually released to the public 6 to 7 months after the close of the reference quarter.16 15 For a description of an annual update of the ITAs, see the most recent July issue of the Survey. 16 As noted in footnote 9, some preliminary information from the QCEW is incorporated into the quarterly estimates on a delayed basis.

The aggregate data are compiled based on stratified probability samples of tax or information returns. The data collected include by-industry information on assets, business receipts and deductions, and net income. The source data are primarily used in estimating corporate profits and nonfarm proprietors’ income. The data for nonfarm sole proprietorships and partnerships are released to the public about 1 ½–1 ¾ years after the end of the tax year, and the data for corporations are released to the public about 1 ¾ years after the end of the tax year.17 Federal government annual budget, a report prepared by the Office of Management and Budget, presents preliminary estimates of U.S. Government receipts and expenditures for the current fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) and revised data for the preceding fiscal year, as well as the President’s proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Data are provided on budget receipts by source, such as individual and corporate income taxes, and on budget outlays by function, such as national defense and Medicare. These source data are primarily used in estimating federal government spending and wages and salaries. The report is usually released in early February. Source data for the comprehensive updates Comprehensive updates of the NIPAs are carried out about every 5 years, and they may result in revisions that extend back for many years. These revisions are timed to incorporate the infrequent but most comprehensive source data, and they also provide the opportunity to incorporate definitional, statistical, and presentational improvements to the accounts. Generally, comprehensive updates replace the annual update that would normally take place in that year, and so they also incorporate the source data that would normally be incorporated in the annual update.

    "text": "CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA 3-15 Benchmark Input-Output (I-O) Accounts, prepared by BEA, are U.S. economic accounts that provide detailed statistics on economic processes and the relationships between various industries in the U.S. economy. The core of the I-O accounts consists of the “supply” table, which shows the value of each commodity produced by each industry, and the “use” table, which shows the consumption of each commodity by each industry or final user. The benchmark I-O accounts, which are prepared at about 5-year intervals, incorporate a vast amount of source data, the most important of which are data from the Economic Census. The I-O account estimates are used extensively as benchmarks for many of the corresponding NIPA estimates, but I-O accounts also directly incorporate some of the NIPA estimates, such as the estimates for owner-occupied housing and for motor vehicles. The benchmark I-O accounts are released as part of the comprehensive update of the National Economic Accounts, which include the NIPAs and the Industry Economic Accounts.18 Economic Census conducted by the Census Bureau, is a mandatory census that provides a detailed portrait of the nation’s economy once every 5 years.19 The Economic Census consists of several censuses that cover nearly all private industries, including manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, construction, transportation, information, services, and finance and insurance.20 In the 2007 Economic Census, report forms were sent to the establishments of all large employers (all multi-establishment firms and all firms with a payroll above a specified cutoff) and to a stratified sample of small employers (single-establishment firms with payroll below the cutoff). Statistics for selected small employers (for example, those with fewer than 10 employees) and all firms without employees were compiled from administrative records of the IRS and other federal government agencies. The Economic Census is the most important data source for the benchmark I-O accounts. Results from the Economic Census are released over a period of several years. Census of Governments, which is conducted by the Census Bureau in the same years as the Economic Census, is a voluntary census that provides periodic and comprehensive statistics about governments and governmental activities. The census covers all state and local governments, including counties, cities, townships, special districts, and school districts. Data are collected on revenues, expenditures, debt, assets, 18 Effective with the September 2020 release of GDP, BEA accelerated both industry and state quarterly GDP to align with the third estimate of U.S. GDP for each quarter. In September 2022 and September 2023, BEA concurrently produced and published annual, and then comprehensive, updates of national, industry, and state statistics. NIPA and industry statistics had been fully integrated, but published over several months, since the 2013 cycle of comprehensive updates of the NIPAs and release of the benchmark I-O accounts. Previously, benchmark I-O accounts were released first, and thus they were not fully consistent with the revised NIPA estimates. For more information on the synchronization of the accounts, see the box on “Bringing Together National, Industry, and Regional” in “Preview of the 2023 Comprehensive Update of the National Economic Accounts,” Survey 103 (June 2023).

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-2 • Over time, source data may emerge or disappear, so new source data must be identified and evaluated, and estimating methods must be adapted accordingly. • Advances in statistical techniques or in other aspects of estimation must be evaluated for adoption into the methodology. • As the U.S. economy evolves, the methodologies must be updated to ensure that the estimates continue to provide a reliable and relevant picture of transactions and transactors in the economy. The examples provided in this chapter are simplified in order to illustrate the basic estimating concepts and calculations. In practice, the procedures used for deriving the NIPAs involve complex statistical techniques that are designed to ensure consistency across the entire time series for a given estimate and between interrelated estimates. Current-Dollar Estimates For most NIPA components, the current-dollar, or nominal, estimates are derived from source data that are “value data,” which reflect the product of quantity and price. For the estimates that are not derived from value data, separate quantity data and price data must be combined. For example, an estimate of expenditures on new autos may be calculated as the number of autos sold times expenditure per auto (at transaction prices—that is, the average list price with options adjusted for transportation charges, sales taxes, dealer discounts, and rebates). An estimate of wages may be calculated as employment times average hourly earnings times average hours worked, and an estimate of interest received may be calculated as the stock of interest-bearing assets times an effective interest rate. (The NIPA current-dollar estimates are expressed at annual rates; see the appendix to this chapter.) Adjustments to the source data BEA makes three general types of adjustments to the source data that are incorporated into the NIPA estimates. The first consists of adjustments that are needed so that the data conform to appropriate NIPA concepts and definitions. For example, Internal Revenue Service data from corporate tax returns include estimates of depreciation, but these estimates are based on historical-cost valuation and on tax service lives. BEA must adjust these estimates to the NIPA definition of depreciation—consumption of fixed capital—which is based on current-cost valuation and economic service lives. The second type of adjustment involves filling gaps in coverage. For example, one of the primary sources for the quarterly estimates of the change in private inventories component of",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-3 GDP is the Census Bureau’s Monthly Wholesale Trade Survey. However, this source does not cover inventories of nonmerchant wholesalers (wholesalers that do not take title to the goods they sell). Thus, the survey data must be augmented by separate BEA estimates for the change in the inventories of these wholesalers. The third type of adjustment involves time of recording and valuation. For example, in the NIPAs (as in BEA’s International Transactions Accounts), imported goods are valued at “foreign port value”—that is, the value at the point of exportation to the United States. The source data on imports of goods from Canada, which the Census Bureau receives in a bilateral data exchange with Canada, are often valued at the point of manufacture; thus, BEA must adjust these data to foreign port value by adding the cost of transporting these goods within Canada from the point of manufacture to the point of export to the United States. In addition, source data must occasionally be adjusted to account for special circumstances that affect the accuracy of the data. For example, the monthly current employment statistics are collected in the middle of the month, which is assumed to represent conditions during the entire month. Thus, these source data may need to be adjusted if a significant event, such as a blizzard that blankets much of the eastern United States, occurs during that period. Seasonal adjustment Seasonal adjustment of a time series removes the average effect of variations that normally occur at about the same time and in about the same magnitude each year—for example, the effect of weather or holidays. After seasonal adjustment, trends, business cycles, and other movements in the time series stand out more clearly. Table 4.1 and figure 4.1 illustrate the effects of seasonally adjusting a series that exhibits a significant seasonal pattern. The unadjusted series shows a pattern of consistent strength in the second and third quarters and corresponding weakness in the first and fourth quarters. The seasonally adjusted series removes that seasonal component resulting in a series that reflects trends, business cycles, and other movements. Most of the source data agencies that provide BEA with data provide both seasonally adjusted data and not seasonally adjusted data. Where seasonally adjusted data are provided, BEA uses them to estimate quarterly and monthly NIPA estimates.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-4 For source data that are not available on a seasonally adjusted basis, BEA evaluates those series for seasonality using the Census Bureau’s X-13 ARIMA software.2 Where seasonality is identified, the seasonal adjustment applied to the source data that underlie NIPA estimates generally reflects concurrent factors that are updated as additional data observations become available over the course of the year. Where seasonality is not found, the seasonally adjusted estimates will equal the not seasonally adjusted estimates (see the box “Introduction of Not Seasonally Adjusted Estimates”). Where necessary, adjustments are made to ensure that seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted quarterly values sum to the annual value for a given year. Each year, as part of the annual NIPA update, BEA closely examines the seasonal adjustment of selected source data underlying the NIPA estimates. As part of this annual evaluation, the seasonality of each series is evaluated, model specifications for deriving seasonal factors are updated, and seasonal factors are recalculated. At a minimum, the updated factors are applied to the quarters and months for the most recent five years, consistent with BEA’s general revision policies and with seasonal adjustment best practices. In addition to examining selected source data, BEA also tests all NIPA series for seasonality. NIPA aggregates, which are indirectly seasonally adjusted by aggregating seasonally adjusted component detail, are carefully evaluated for residual seasonality.3 As part of the 2018 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA introduced measures of GDP, GDI, and their major components that are not seasonally adjusted. These measures facilitate analyses of seasonal adjustment methods by distinguishing movements that are attributable to underlying source data from those that attributable to seasonal adjustment (see “Introduction of Not Seasonally Adjusted Estimates,” below). 2 X-13 ARIMA is a software program developed by the Census Bureau to identify and remove seasonal effects from a time series; for more information, see the Census Bureau website at www.census.gov. On occasions where a series lacks a sufficient time span to derive seasonal factors, BEA may use smoothing techniques such as moving averages to reduce seasonality in the data. 3 Residual seasonality is a manifestation of seasonal patterns in data that have already been seasonally adjusted. For more information on residual seasonality and BEA’s associated research and improvements, see Benjamin Cowan, Shelly Smith, and Sarahelen Thompson, “Seasonal Adjustment in the National Income and Product Accounts: Results from the 2018 Comprehensive Update,” Survey of Current Business 98 (August 2018).

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-6 Not Seasonally Adjusted Estimates As part of the 2018 comprehensive update of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), BEA introduced new not seasonally adjusted (NSA) quarterly estimates for GDP, GDI, and their major components; quarterly estimates are available for 1947 forward.1 The NSA estimates are an additional tool that may be used to evaluate quarterly economic performance and to distinguish movements attributable to the unadjusted underlying source data from those attributable to seasonal adjustment. As with seasonally adjusted estimates, the NSA estimates are often based on source data that are compiled for purposes other than measuring domestic production; as a result, the construction of NSA estimates is similar to the construction of their seasonally adjusted counterparts. Specifically, when NSA source data are available, they are adjusted to align with NIPA conventions. They then provide the indicator or pattern series for the corresponding NSA NIPA estimate (see section below on “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series). When source data are unavailable, most NSA estimates are set equal to their SA counterpart. The NSA estimates are presented in Section 8 of the NIPA Interactive Data Tables.2 For GDP and its major components, the tables present nominal, or “current-dollar” measures, “real,” or inflation–adjusted measures (expressed as a chain-type quantity index and as chained 2017 dollars), and price indexes. For GDI and its major components, nominal measures are presented. The quarterly estimates are expressed at quarterly, not annual, rates.3 In addition, BEA presents the percent change from the same quarter one year ago for real GDP and its major components in NIPA table 8.1.11. The rate of change published for these NSA estimates is calculated from the same quarter 1 year ago to reduce the variations observed from seasonal fluctuations and to reveal data trends over the course of a year. This rate is not comparable to the quarterly rate of change published for BEA's featured seasonally adjusted series, which is calculated from the preceding quarter, and expressed at a compound annual rate. Comparing NSA estimates from the same quarter 1 year ago does not necessarily remove seasonal patterns from the data. Calendar effects, such as the timing of holidays and trading days, as well as other special events can influence the estimates and cause year-over-year comparisons to be misleading. For these reasons, seasonally adjusted statistics are preferred for evaluating growth in BEA's GDP and GDI statistics. Updates to the estimates will follow the same publication schedule as the seasonally adjusted statistics. 1. The NSA estimates are not comparable to BEA’s previously published current-dollar GDP NSA estimates, which were discontinued in 2008. The earlier estimates were largely based on SIC-based data and were published once a year as part of the NIPA annual updates. NSA GDI, real GDP, and GDP price estimates were not provided. 2. Prior to the 2018 comprehensive update, BEA presented not seasonally adjusted estimates for federal and state and local government current receipts and expenditures in NIPA tables 3.22 and 3.23 that were published once a year; the two tables are now renumbered as tables 8.3 and 8.4, respectively and are published at the same time as the seasonally adjusted estimates. 3. For more details on the presentation of NIPA estimates, see the section on “Where are the NIPA estimates available?” in Chapter 1: Estimating Methods. BEA does not publish annual frequency NSA data because the NSA quarterly estimates are reconciled to the seasonally adjusted annual estimates with the annual and comprehensive updates of the NIPAs.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-7 Moving average A moving average is a calculation that is used to smooth a data series that is characterized by volatile short-term fluctuations. As a result, trend and cyclical movements in the smoothed series will be more apparent, and the series can be better used as an indicator for interpolation and extrapolation (see below). Table 4.2 illustrates the smoothing effects of a three-quarter moving average on a volatile series. The simple moving average is calculated by summing the value in a given quarter and in the preceding two quarters and dividing by 3 (in year 1:III, (90.0 + 120.0 + 100.0) ∕ 3 = 103.3). A weighted moving average is calculated by assigning greater weight to the time periods that are deemed more relevant. In this example, the weighted moving average is calculated by weighting the current quarter at 50 percent, and the two preceding quarters at 25 percent each (in year 1:III, ( (90.0 × 0.50) + (120.0 × 0.25) + (100.0 × 0.25) = 100.0). Table 4.2—Example of Moving-Average Calculation Time period Original series Simple moving average Weighted moving average Year 1:I 100.0 ….. ….. Year 1:II 120.0 ….. …..

This would have the effect of shifting the moving-average series back one quarter (in the example, the value of the centered moving average would be 103.3 in year 1:II, and so forth through 123.3 in year 2:III).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-8 Best level and best change Source data are incorporated into the NIPA estimates on either a “best-level” or a “best- change” basis. Best level provides the most accurate value for an economic statistic at a specified point in time using the best available source data. For example, in a comprehensive update of the NIPAs, data from the quinquennial Economic Census are incorporated into the estimates on a best-level basis. However, it is not practical to revise the entire NIPA time series every time new or revised source data become available. Thus, these data are often initially introduced into the estimates on a best-change basis. Best change provides the most accurate measure of the period- to-period movement in an economic statistic using the best available source data. In an annual update of the NIPAs, data from the annual surveys of manufacturing and trade are generally incorporated into the estimates on a best-change basis. In the current quarterly estimates, most of the components are estimated on a best-change basis from the annual levels established at the most recent annual update. In table 4.3, the original series of source data (column 1) has been revised as shown by the best-level series (column 3). In the example, the level of the series has been revised up in all years, perhaps reflecting a change in definition, and the percent changes in the series have been revised to incorporate new statistical information. In an annual NIPA revision, the revised levels of the source data cannot be fully incorporated, because annual updates only cover the 5 most recent years.4 As can be seen in this example, incorporating the revised best-level series only for years 2–4 would result in a discontinuity between the unrevised estimate for year 1 (100.0) and the revised estimate for year 2 (115.0) (a 15.0-percent increase rather than the 10.6-percent increase indicated by the source data). To avoid this problem, the revised source data are instead incorporated on a best-change basis—that is, a new best-change series is created by beginning with the value in the unrevised year 1 (100.0) and applying the percent changes in the best-level series (column 4). As a result, the level of the new series (column 5) is kept consistent with the level of the earlier unrevised year, while the percent changes in the new series (column 6) fully reflect the new statistical information that was incorporated into the source data. In the next comprehensive update, the revised best-levels would be incorporated into the NIPA estimates. 4 As part of the 2018 comprehensive revision of the NIPAs, BEA changed the typical open period for annual updates of the NIPAs from 3 to 5 years. As part of the “flexible” approach to annual updates that BEA introduced in 2010, the open period may be extended beyond 5 years to allow for the incorporation of improvements in methodology. See Pamela A. Kelly, Stephanie H. McCulla, and David B. Wasshausen, “Improved Estimates of the National Income and Product Accounts: Results of the 2018 Comprehensive Update,” Survey 98 (September 2018) and “BEA Briefing: Improving BEA’s Accounts Through Flexible Annual Revisions,” Survey 88 (June 2008): 29–32..",

Thus, for most estimates, the more frequent but less comprehensive source data may be used as an indicator of the movements of the component series rather than as a measure of the absolute levels of the series. Specifically, for the periods for which annual estimates are available and the quarterly estimates must be forced to average to these annual totals, the quarterly pattern is estimated by interpolation. For the periods not yet covered by annual estimates (such as the current quarter), the quarterly estimates are made by extrapolation. The use of an indicator series to estimate a component is illustrated in table 4.4. We begin with a value of $200 (annual rate) for the fourth quarter of year 1 (this value was determined by the preceding year’s calculation) and a value of $220 for the year 2 (this value was determined from an annual data source). Because the detailed source data are not available on a quarterly basis, the estimates for the quarters of year 2 are interpolated using an indicator series whose movements are deemed to approximate those of the component series. In this simplified example, the interpolation of the quarterly values is accomplished by calculating a time series that begins with the established value ($200) for the fourth quarter of year 1 and progresses through the four quarters of year 2 at the same rate of change as the indicator series: for year 2:I, $200 + ($200 × 0.20) = $240; for year 2:II, $240 + ($240 × –0.167) = $200; and so forth. As necessary, the calculated series is then adjusted to ensure that the average for the four quarters of year 2 is equal to the established annual value for year 2: for year 2:I, $240 × ($220 ∕ $240) = $220; for year 2:II, $200 × (220 ∕ $240) = $183.3; and so forth.",

Currently, BEA is using a procedure known as the “proportional Denton method” or “quadratic minimization.” In its most common application, this approach interpolates series by minimizing the sum of the squared differences of the ratios of the interpolated series and the indicator series. Formally, the interpolation is estimated by the following optimization problem: where z is the indicator series, x is the interpolated series, A are the annual controls that the interpolated series must sum to, and N is the number of years for the interpolation. This example shows an annual-to-quarterly interpolation. The same method can also be used for annual-to- monthly and quarterly-to-monthly interpolation.5 5 See Baoline Chen and Stephen H.

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-11 Three special estimation methods In certain cases where primary source data are not available, one or more of the following special methods—commodity flow, retail control, or perpetual inventory—may be used to estimate values. Commodity-flow method The commodity-flow method is generally used to derive estimates in economic census years for various components of consumer spending, equipment and software, and the commodity detail for state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment. An abbreviated form of this method is used to prepare estimates of investment in equipment in nonbenchmark years, and an even more abbreviated form is used to prepare the current quarterly estimates of investment in equipment.6 The commodity-flow method begins with estimates of the domestic output or domestic sales of a commodity valued in producers’ prices.7 Then, estimates of the domestic supply of that commodity—the amount that is available for domestic consumption—are prepared by adding imports and by subtracting exports and inventory change. Next, the domestic supply of the commodity is allocated among domestic purchasers—that is, persons, business, and government. Finally, the estimates are converted to purchasers’ prices.8 The commodity-flow method is illustrated in table 4.5. First, domestic shipments—the value of shipments of the commodity produced by domestic firms at producers’ prices—are converted to net supply, by adding imports and subtracting exports, government purchases, and change in inventories (a positive change in inventories reduces net supply and a negative change in inventories raises net supply) (in the example, $100 + $40 – $10 – $5 – $5 = $120). Portions of the net supply are then allocated among business intermediate purchases and consumer spending. This allocation may be based on relationships from the most recent Economic Census or on information from other sources (such as spending by consumers as determined by the retail control method). In this example, it is assumed that one-fourth of net supply is allocated to business intermediate purchases and one-sixth to personal consumption expenditures. Investment in equipment (prior to adjustments for transportation costs and wholesale and retail trade margins) is then computed as net supply less business intermediate purchases and consumer 6 For more information on using the commodity-flow method to prepare the estimates of investment in equipment, see “Chapter 6: Private Fixed Investment.” 7 Producers’ prices are the prices received by producers for the goods and services they sell. These prices include sales and excise taxes but exclude domestic transportation costs and trade margins. Trade margins, or markups, reflect the value added by wholesalers and retailers in the distribution of a commodity from producers to final purchasers. 8 Purchasers’ prices are the prices paid by intermediate and final purchasers for the goods and services they buy. These prices are equal to producers’ prices plus domestic transportation costs and trade margins.",

This estimate is then converted to purchasers’ prices by adding domestic transportation costs and trade margins ($70 + $5 + $10 = $85).

In these years, the estimate of total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) on most goods is derived by extrapolation from the benchmark year using a retail control total of sales by most kinds of business from the Census Bureau’s monthly and annual surveys. In general, product-based data on consumer spending are not available in nonbenchmark years, so the estimates for the detailed PCE categories are prepared by extrapolation using estimates of retail sales by corresponding product lines that, in turn, are based on retail sales by kind of business and on commodity sales data from the most recent quinquennial Economic Census.9 Then, the extrapolated estimates are adjusted proportionately so that their sum is equal to that for total PCE.10 9 The estimates for some PCE categories, such as consumer purchases of new and used motor vehicles and of motor vehicle fuels, are prepared independently. 10 For more information on using the retail control method to prepare the PCE estimates, see “Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures.”",

First, the PCE control total for year 2 is derived by extrapolation, using the change in the retail control total from year 1 to year 2 (89 × (120 ∕ 100) = 106.8). In year 1, a benchmark year, information from the Economic Census is available to break sales down into product lines (and to corresponding PCE categories) for each kind of business (such as “grocery stores”). In year 2, the annual survey of retail sales provides data on sales by kind of business but not on sales by individual product lines. In order to estimate sales by product line for year 2, the product-line distribution of sales from year 1 is applied to the sales by kind of business for year 2 (for kind of business A, 0.2 × 60 = 12 for product line 1, and 0.8 × 60 = 48 for product line 2). Total sales for each product line are then computed by summing across all kinds of business (for product line 1, 12 + 36 = 48; and for product line 2, 48 + 24 = 72). The retail sales product lines in the Census Bureau’s data and the PCE categories in the NIPAs do not always match (in the example, product line 1 at 44 is larger than PCE category 1 at 33). Thus, the retail sales data are used to extrapolate the PCE estimates for year 2 (for product line 1, 33 × (48 ∕ 44) = 36). Finally, the PCE category estimates must be adjusted so they sum to the PCE control total for year 2 (for product line 1, the adjusted estimate for year 2 is 36 × (106.8 ∕ 108) = 35.6).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-16 Quantity and Price Estimates Estimates for all of the NIPA aggregates and components are presented in current dollars. Changes in current-dollar estimates measure the changes in the market values of goods or services that are produced or sold in the economy. For many purposes, it is necessary to decompose these changes into price and quantity components. In the NIPAs, prices and quantities are expressed as index numbers with the reference year—at present, the year 2017— equal to 100. For selected series, quantities—or “real” (inflation adjusted) measures—are also expressed in chained (2017) dollars. (Period-to-period changes in quantities and prices are expressed as percent changes at annual rates; see “Statistical Tools and Conventions” in the appendix to this chapter.) BEA prepares quantity estimates for GDP and its product-side components and for a few other aggregates and components. (For an illustration of the calculation of these estimates from a set of quantity and price information, see “Calculation of Output and Price Indexes” in the appendix to this chapter.) Estimates for detailed components For the detailed NIPA components, the quantity estimates are prepared using one of three methods—deflation, quantity extrapolation, or direct valuation—depending on the availability of source data. The quantity estimates are expressed as real values with 2017 (at present) as the reference year. Deflation Because the source data available for most components of GDP are measured in dollars rather than in units, the quantities of most of the detailed components are obtained by deflation. For deflation, quantities are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by an “appropriate” price index (with the reference-year value set to 100): Qt = (ptqt)∕(pt∕po) where pt and qt are observed prices and quantities in the current year and po is the observed price in the reference year.13 13 A price index is appropriate if its definition and coverage closely match those of the series being deflated.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-17 Thus, for example, if the current-dollar value for the component series is $14 in 2013 and the appropriate price index is 112 in 2013, then the quantity estimate for the component series in 2013 is ($14 ∕ (112 ∕ 100)), or $12.50. The price indexes used for deflation are generally adjusted for changes in characteristics or quality as described in the appendix to this chapter. Quantity extrapolation The other two methods are similar in that they both are derived using quantity data. Quantity extrapolation is used when a quantity indicator series is available that approximates the movements of the component series. In this method, the quantity estimate is obtained by using the indicator series to extrapolate from the reference-year value: Qt = poqo+((poqo) × ((qt′ –qo′)∕qo′)) where q′ represents the quantity indicator series. For example, if the dollar value of the component series is $10 in 2017 and the quantity indicator series shows an increase of 25 percent in 2018, then the quantity estimate for the component series in 2018 is ($10 + ($10 × 25/100)), or $12.50. Direct valuation Direct valuation is used when physical quantity data and price data are available. In this method, the quantity estimate is obtained by multiplying the reference-year price by the actual quantity data for the current year: Qt = poqt. For example, if the price of the detailed component is $.50 per unit in 2017 and the quantity measure is 20 units in 2017 and 25 units in 2018, then the quantity estimate for the component series in 2018 is ($.50 × 25), or $12.50. Estimates for NIPA aggregates The fundamental problem confronting the efforts to adjust GDP and other aggregates for inflation is that there is not a single inflation number but rather a wide spectrum of goods and services with prices that are changing relative to one another over time.

In the NIPAs, the annual changes in quantities and prices are calculated using a Fisher formula that incorporates weights from 2 adjacent years.14 For example, the 2014–2015 change in real GDP uses prices for 2014 and 2015 as weights, and the 2014–2015 change in prices uses quantities for 2014 and 2015 as weights. These annual changes are “chained” (multiplied) together to form time series of quantity and price indexes. Quarterly changes in quantities and prices are calculated using a Fisher formula that incorporates weights from two adjacent quarters; quarterly indexes are adjusted for consistency to the annual indexes before percent changes are calculated. The Fisher index ( F t Q ) for calculating real GDP (and other aggregate measures of output and expenditures) in year t relative to its value in the previous year t-1 is where the p's and q's represent prices and quantities of detailed components in the 2 years. Because the first term in the Fisher formula is a Laspeyres quantity index ( QL t ): and the second term is a Paasche quantity index ( P t Q ): the Fisher formula can also be expressed for year t as the geometric mean of these indexes as follows: 14 This formula is named after Irving Fisher, who originally developed this index to more accurately measure quantity and price changes over time. , q p q p q p q p = Q 1 -t t t t 1 -t 1 -t t 1 -t F t ∑ ∑ × ∑ ∑ , q p q p = Q 1 -t 1 -t t 1 -t L t ∑ ∑ , q p q p = Q 1 -t t t t P t ∑ ∑ ✓--",

All quarterly chain-type indexes for completed years that have been included in an annual or comprehensive update are adjusted so that the quarterly indexes average to the corresponding annual index. When an additional year is completed between annual updates, the annual index is computed as the average of the quarterly indexes, so no adjustment is required to make the quarterly and annual indexes consistent.

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-20 Properties of chain-type measures The chain-type indexes based on the Fisher formula have several advantages over the fixed-weighted indexes that BEA used before 1996.15 • They produce percent changes in quantities and prices that are not affected by the choice of the reference period. • They eliminate the substitution bias in measures of real GDP growth that are derived using fixed-weighted indexes. This bias tends to cause an understatement of growth for periods before the reference year and an overstatement of growth for periods after the reference year. • They eliminate the distortions of growth in components and in industries that result from the fixed-weighted indexes. • They eliminate the anomalies that arise from using recent-period weights to measure periods in the past when a far different set of prices prevailed. For example, the prices of defense equipment in the 2000s are not appropriate for measuring the real changes in defense spending in the 1940s. • They eliminate the inconvenience and confusion associated with BEA’s previous practice of updating weights and years—and thereby rewriting economic history—about every 5 years. Despite the greater accuracy provided by the chain-type indexes, users of macroeconomic statistics need more than index numbers and percent changes. The earlier fixed-weighted estimates were denominated in constant dollars, and the real levels for the components of GDP added up to total GDP. Because the system was additive, the shares of the real components reflected their relative importance in total GDP. Similarly, in decomposing total GDP growth by component, the change in constant-dollar values measured the component’s contribution to the change in the fixed-weighted aggregate. For GDP and most of its components, BEA prepares estimates in chained dollars as well as chain-type indexes (see the appendix to this chapter). However, because these chained-dollar measures are not based on a single set of weights, they are not additive and thus do not yield accurate measures of shares and contributions to growth. 15 For information on BEA’s introduction of chain-type indexes as its featured measure of real output and prices, see J.

Parker, “Preview of the Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: BEA’s New Featured Measures of Output and Prices,” Survey 75 (July 1995): 31–38. See also J.

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-22 APPENDIX Calculation of Output and Price Indexes The market (and nonmarket) values used to measure GDP and the other NIPA estimates are in current dollars—that is, they represent the values of transactions taking place in the current time period. In turn, these transactions reflect a combination of physical quantities and prices. As shown in exhibit 4.1, in year 1, 10 apples at a price of $0.20 per apple can be purchased for $2.00. If the transactions in a given time period are compared with those in another time period, the differences in the current-dollar values can be attributed to differences in quantities and to differences in prices. In year 2, 20 apples at a price of $0.25 per apple can be purchased for $5.00. The increase in expenditures from $2.00 to $5.00, or 150 percent, can be separated into quantity and price elements. The quantity of apples purchased increased from 10 to 20, or 100 percent, and the price of apples increased from $0.20 to $0.25 or 25 percent. Exhibit 4.1 Year 1 Expenditures Quantity Price Apples $2.00 10 $0.20 Oranges $3.00 30 $0.10 Total fruit $5.00 Year 2 Apples $5.00 20 $0.25 Oranges $4.00 20 $0.20 Total fruit $9.00 For most NIPA components, estimates of physical quantities are not available. Instead, “real” estimates—that is, estimates that exclude the effects of price change—are derived by “deflating” (dividing) the current-dollar value by appropriate price indexes. In order to prepare such estimates, a statistical application must be used that establishes a common unit price as the basis for comparison. For exhibit 4.1, one way to accomplish this is to value the second-period transaction in the price of the first period: 20 apples at the year 1 price of $0.20 is equal to $4.00, and so the real estimate increases from $2.00 in year 1 to $4.00 in year 2, or 100 percent. Alternatively, the first-period transaction could have been valued in second-period prices: 10 apples at the year 2 price of $0.25 is equal to $2.50, and so the real estimate increases from $2.50 in year 1 to $5.00 in year 2, or 100 percent.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-23 Thus, the separation of current-dollar change into price and quantity elements for a single, detailed component is straightforward. However, for an aggregation of detailed components, price changes and quantity changes cannot be observed directly in the economy. Thus, the partitioning of the current-dollar change into price- and quantity-change elements becomes an analytic process. The price and quantity changes must be calculated, and the calculation method is determined by analytic requirements. Because of the complexity of the interactions of prices and quantities, the method of calculating real estimates for the NIPAs has evolved over time. Estimates of real GNP and other components were introduced into the NIPAs in the early 1950s as a supplement to the current-dollar estimates. These measures were calculated by specifying a single base period set of prices and then valuing the output of all periods using those prices. As shown in calculation 1 in exhibit 4.2 (page 4–19), which uses year 1 for valuation, the real estimate for the change in fruit from year 1 to year 2 is 20 percent. This approach, in which the real estimates are calculated moving forward from the base period, is called a “Laspeyres” quantity index. However, the results of the calculation are dependent on the choice of the base year for valuation. In calculation 2, which uses year 2 for valuation, the real estimate for the change in fruit from year 1 to year 2 is 6 percent. This approach, in which the estimates are calculated moving backward from the current period, is called a “Paasche” quantity index. Corresponding calculations can be made to produce Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes. Before 1996, the real estimates in the NIPAs were calculated as Laspeyres quantity indexes, and the price estimates were calculated as implicit price deflators.16 In calculation 4, the estimate for the change in the price of fruit from year 1 to year 2 is 50 percent. Note that one property of these estimates is that the index for total expenditures on fruit in year 2 ($9.00 / $5.00, or 1.800) is equal to the Laspeyres quantity index for year 2 multiplied by the Paasche price index for year 2: 1.200 × 1.500 = 1.800. In 1996, BEA introduced chain-weighted indexes as its featured measure of the change in real GDP and in prices. These indexes, which are based on weights that are more appropriate to the time period being measured, significantly improved the accuracy of the NIPA estimates. The weights for these measures are calculated as the geometric mean of the calculations for the Laspeyres index and the Paasche index (in exhibit 4.1, as the square root of 1.200 × 1.059, or 1.127). Similarly, price measures are computed using weights calculated as the geometric mean of the calculations for the Laspeyres index and the Paasche index (in exhibit 1, as the square root 16 In the exhibit, all calculations involve only 2 years, so the Paasche price index and the implicit price deflator are equivalent.",

Adjusting for quality change Accurate price indexes are crucial for preparing accurate estimates of real GDP as well as corresponding productivity measures.

The development of a price index becomes more complicated when the characteristics or quality of Exhibit 4.2 Calculation 1: Laspeyres Quantity Index Year 1 weighted quantity change measure for fruit: hypothetical expenditure on fruit in year 2 using year 1 prices, divided by actual expenditure on fruit in year 1 [(20 × $0.20) + (20 × $0.10)] ∕ [(10 × $0.20) + (30 × $0.10)] = $6.00 ∕ $5.00 = 1.200 Calculation 2: Paasche Quantity Index Year 2 weighted quantity change measure for fruit: actual expenditure on fruit in year 2, divided by hypothetical expenditure on fruit in year 1 using year 2 prices [(20 × $0.25) + (20 × $0.20)] ∕ [(10 × $0.25) + (30 × $0.20)] =$9.00 ∕ $8.50 = 1.059 Calculation 3: Laspeyres Price Index Year 1 weighted price change measure for fruit: [(10 × $0.25) + (30 × $0.20)] ∕ [(10 × $0.20) + (30 × $0.10)] = $8.50 ∕ $5.00 = 1.700 Calculation 4: Paasche Price Index Year 2 weighted price change measure for fruit: [(20 × $0.25) + (20 × $0.20)] ∕ [(20 × $0.20) + (20 × $0.10)] =$9.00 ∕ $6.00 = 1.500",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-25 the goods or services are also changing. In these cases, the price index must isolate and measure only the price change and not the impacts of these other changes. There are several methods used to construct price indexes, and while most of these are designed to measure price change while holding quality constant, no method is perfect in every situation.17 Traditional matched model indexes, which hold quality constant by specifying each variety in the sample and ensuring that exactly the same variety of product is sampled each period, work well with relatively standardized products. However, these indexes are less accurate when the characteristics, quality, market shares, and prices are changing rapidly. In such cases, alternative methods for quality adjustment may yield more accurate measures. The attribute-cost adjustment method, adopted recently by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to construct the consumer price index (CPI) for computers, uses monetary values of the attributes that affect price, obtained from the original equipment manufacturers or from price compiler websites, to determine appropriate quality adjustments.18 The hedonic method uses regression analysis to determine statistical relationships between observed price changes and changes in the characteristics and qualities of the products, and these relationships are used to hold quality constant; this method is used by BLS in many of its producer and consumer price indexes and by the Census Bureau in its housing construction and sales price indexes. Both techniques have been shown to produce price indexes that are more accurate than traditional matched model indexes in cases of rapid change.19 BEA’s primary source of indexes to deflate GDP and its components is BLS, which provides detailed price indexes—including consumer price indexes, producer price indexes, and international price indexes. These indexes, as well as other indexes from BLS, the Census Bureau, and other federal agencies, all employ methodologies to adjust for quality change. In cases where quality-adjusted indexes have not been available, BEA has developed its own indexes. For example, for a number of years in the 1980s and early 1990s, BEA produced hedonic indexes for computers; as BLS began publishing quality-adjusted PPIs for computers and peripheral equipment in the 1990s, BEA adjusted its methodologies to incorporate them. In the late 1990s, BEA introduced quality- adjusted price indexes for semiconductors, for digital telephone switching equipment, and for computer software; more recently, BEA has introduced a hedonic price index for photocopying equipment.20 17 An exception is a unit value index, which measures the change in the value of items without holding characteristics, quality, or even the mix of items constant. 18 For more information on how BLS calculates the CPI for computers, see https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/personal-computers.htm. 19 For more information on the hedonic method underlying producer and consumer price indexes, see Chapter 14, Producer Prices, and Chapter 17, The Consumer Price Index, of the BLS Handbook of Methods. For more information on the hedonic method underlying housing price indexes, see the information available on the Census website at https://www.census.gov/construction/cpi/. 20 For more information these quality-adjustment techniques, see “Prices and Output for Information and Communication Technologies,” on BEA’s website.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-26 Statistical Tools and Conventions This section describes some of the statistical tools and conventions that BEA uses in preparing and presenting the NIPA estimates. In general, these statistical operations are used to transform the estimates into alternative formats that facilitate analytical or presentational uses. Chained-dollar measures As a supplement to its chain-type quantity indexes, BEA prepares measures of real GDP and its components in a dollar-denominated form, designated “chained (2017) dollar” estimates. For GDP and most other series, the chained-dollar value CD F t is calculated by multiplying the reference year current-dollar value q p b b ∑ )by the chain-type Fisher quantity index ( I F t ) and dividing by 100. For period t, /100 I Ft q p = CDFt b b × ∑ . Thus, for example, if a current-dollar GDP component is equal to $200 in 2017 and if the quantity index for this component increased 15 percent by 2020, then the chained (2017) dollar value of this component in 2020 would be $200 x 115 ∕ 100, or $230. The chained (2017) dollar estimates provide measures to calculate the percent changes for GDP and its components that are consistent with those calculated from the chain-type quantity indexes; any differences are small and due to rounding. For most components of GDP, the chained-dollar estimates also provide rough approximations of their relative importance and of their contributions to real GDP growth for years close to 2017. However, for components— such as computers and other high-tech equipment—with rapid growth in real output and sharply falling prices, the chained-dollar levels (as distinct from chain-weighted indexes and percent changes) will overstate their relative importance to GDP growth. In addition, chained-dollar values for the detailed GDP components will not necessarily sum to the chained-dollar estimate of GDP (or of any intermediate aggregate), because the relative prices used as weights for any period other than the reference year differ from those used for the reference year. BEA provides a measure of the extent of such differences by showing a “residual” line on chained-dollar tables that indicates the difference between GDP (and other major aggregates) and the sum of the most detailed components in the table. For periods close to the reference year, when there usually has not been much change in the relative prices that are used as the weights for calculating the chain-type index, the residuals",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 4-27 tend to be small, and the chained (2017) dollar estimates can be used to approximate the contributions to growth and to aggregate the detailed estimates. However, it is preferable to use estimates of exact contributions, which are described in the next section. Some exceptions to the above methodology are made for a few components of GDP. For cases in which the components of an aggregate include large negative values, the Fisher formula cannot be used because it would require taking the square root of a negative number. In such cases, one of two other methods is used. • Quantity estimates are calculated as the sum of, or as the difference between, chained- dollar series that measure flows. For example, real net exports is derived as the difference between real exports and real imports. • Quantity estimates are calculated as the difference between measures of chain-weighted stocks. For example, the real annual change in private inventories is derived as the difference between real beginning-of-year inventories and real end-of-year inventories. The inability to calculate a particular Fisher quantity index (for example, for change in private inventories) because of negative values usually does not extend to the calculation of higher level aggregates (for example, quantity indexes for gross private domestic investment and for GDP can be computed). The calculation of contributions to percent change is not affected by negative values, so they can be calculated for all components. The chain-dollar estimates are used in the calculation of another price index, the implicit price deflator (IPD). The IPDFt for period t is calculated as the ratio of the current-dollar value to the corresponding chained-dollar value, multiplied by 100, as follows: For all aggregates and components and for all time periods, the value of the IPD is very close to the value of the corresponding chain-type price index. Note that this definition of the IPD differs from that used before the introduction of chain-type measures in1996, when the IPD was defined as the ratio of the current-dollar value to the corresponding constant-dollar value. Contributions to percent change As one moves further away from the reference year, the residual tends to become larger, and the chained-dollar estimates are less useful for analyses of contributions to growth.

The contributions to percent change in a real aggregate, such as real GDP, provide a measure of the composition of growth in the aggregate that is not affected by the nonadditivity of its components. This property makes contributions to percent change a valuable tool for economic analysis. The contribution to percent change ( ∆ti, C% ) in an aggregate in period t that is attributable to the quantity change in component i is defined by the formula where PF t is the Fisher price index for the aggregate in period t relative to period t-1; pi,t is the price of the component i in period t; and qi,t is the quantity of the component i in period t. The summation with subscript j in the denominator includes all the deflation-level components of the aggregate. Contributions of subaggregates (such as PCE goods) to the percent change of the aggregate (say, PCE or GDP) are calculated by summing the contributions of all the deflation-level components contained in the subaggregate.21 For annual estimates, no adjustments are required for the contributions to sum exactly to the percent change in the aggregate. For quarterly estimates, adjustments are required to offset the effects of adjustments that were made to equate the average of the quarterly estimates to the corresponding annual estimate and to express the percent change at annual rate. The same formula is used for both annual and quarterly estimates of contributions to percent change in all periods. The only variation in the method of calculation is that the annual contributions for the most recent year are based on a weighted average of the quarterly contributions until the next annual update. 21 See Marshall B. Reinsdorf, W. Erwin Diewert, and Christian Ehemann, “Additive Decompositions for Fisher, Tornqvist, and Geometric Mean Indexes,” Journal of Economic and Social Measurement 28 (2002): 51–61, www.econ.ubc.ca/diewert/additive.pdf. , ) ) / (( ) ( ) ) / (( 100 % 1 , 1 , , 1 , , 1 , , , ∑ − − − − × + − × + × = ∆ j t j t j F t t j t i t i t i F t t i t i q p P p q q p P p C",

Annual rates are used so that periods of different lengths—for example, quarters and years—may be easily compared. These annual rates are determined simply by multiplying the estimated rate of activity by 4 (for quarterly data) or by 12 (for monthly data). Growth rates In general, percent changes in the NIPA estimates are also expressed at annual rates, which show the value that would be registered if the pace of activity measured for a time period were maintained for a full year.22 Calculating these changes requires a variant of the compound interest formula, where r is the percent change at an annual rate; GDPt is the level of activity in the later period; GDP0 is the level of activity in the earlier period; m is the periodicity of the data (for example, 1 for annual data and 4 for quarterly data); and n is the number of periods between the earlier and later periods (that is, t-0). Thus, for example, if a component increases from $100 in the first quarter to $105 in the second quarter (5 percent at a quarterly rate), the annual rate of increase is (($105/$100)4/1 – 1) x 100 = 21.6 percent. Rebasing an index In the NIPAs, quantities and prices are generally expressed as index numbers with a reference year—at present, the year 2017—equal to 100. These indexes can easily be rebased to a different reference year without changing the relationship between the series values.

PCE shows how much of the income earned by households is being spent on current consumption as opposed to how much is being saved for future consumption. PCE also provides a comprehensive measure of types of goods and services that are purchased by households. Thus, for example, it shows the portion of spending that is accounted for by discretionary items, such as motor vehicles, or the adjustments that consumers make to changes in prices, such as a sharp run-up in gasoline prices. 2 In addition, the PCE estimates are available monthly, so they can provide an early indication of the course of economic activity in the current quarter.

The PCE estimates are an integral part of the U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts”). Definitions and Concepts PCE measures the goods and services purchased by “persons”—that is, by households and by nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISHs)—who are resident in the United States. Persons resident in the United States are those who are physically located in the United States and who have resided, or expect to reside, in this country for 1 year or more. PCE also includes purchases by U.S. government civilian and military personnel stationed abroad, regardless of the duration of their assignments, and by U.S. residents who are traveling or working abroad for 1 year or less.3 Table 5.1 shows the kinds of transactions that are included in and excluded from PCE. Most of PCE consists of purchases of new goods and of services by households from private business. In addition, PCE includes purchases of new goods and of services by households from government and government enterprises, the costs incurred by NPISHs in providing services on behalf of households, net purchases of used goods by households, and purchases abroad of goods and services by U.S. residents traveling, working, or attending school in foreign countries. PCE also includes expenditures financed by third-party payers on behalf of households, such as employer-paid health insurance and medical care financed through government programs, and it includes expenses associated with life insurance and with private and government employee pension plans. Finally, PCE includes imputed purchases that keep PCE invariant to changes in the way that certain activities are carried out—for example, whether housing is rented or owned or whether employees are paid in cash or in kind. PCE transactions are valued in market prices, including sales and excise taxes. In the NIPAs, final consumption expenditures by NPISHs is the portion of PCE that represents the services that are provided to households by NPISHs without explicit charge (such as the value of the education services provided by a nonprofit college or university that is over and above the tuition and other costs paid by or for the student’s household).

Services that are provided by NPISHs and are paid by or on behalf of households (such as the tuition and other costs) are already accounted for in PCE as purchases by households.

However, these expenditures are included in the source data that underlie the estimates of most individual PCE categories, where they are indistinguishable from expenditures made by U.S. residents. 6 In order to exclude these expenditures from PCE, they are recorded collectively as “Less: Expenditures in the United States by nonresidents” in the category “Net foreign travel”; this entry negates the expenditures by foreign residents that are embedded in the source data. In the NIPAs, the expenditures by foreign residents are also recorded as exports of goods and services; thus, they are included in deriving GDP. PCE is classified by type of product as follows.7 Goods consist primarily of tangible commodities that can be stored or inventoried, but they also include certain intangible products, such as software. Durable goods are goods that have an average useful life of at least 3 years. Nondurable goods are goods that have an average useful life of less than 3 years. Services are commodities that cannot be stored or inventoried and that are usually consumed at the place and time of purchase. This system reflects long-term changes in consumption patterns due to shifts in consumer demographics, income, and tastes; to the increased importance of services; and to the introduction of a wide variety of new products. The system follows recommendations for the classification of household and nonprofit consumption by the international System of National Accounts (SNA), thus maintaining consistency with international standards. PCE by type of product is classified into the following broad categories: • Durable goods: motor vehicles and parts, furnishings and durable household equipment, recreational goods and vehicles, and other durable goods. • Nondurable goods: food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption, clothing and footwear, gasoline and other energy goods, and other nondurable goods. • Services: housing and utilities, health care, transportation services, recreation services, food services and accommodations, financial services and insurance, and other services. residents in the detailed PCE statistics, see Michael Armah and Teresita Teensma, “Research Spotlight: Estimates of Categories of Personal Consumption Expenditures Adjusted for Net Foreign Travel Spending,” Survey 92 (April 2012): 13–21. 5 The portions of travel and passenger fare imports accounted for by business and by government are not offset in PCE. Rather, these purchases are recorded as business intermediate expenditures and as government consumption expenditures, respectively. 6 Passenger fares paid by foreign residents to U.S. carriers for transportation to and from the United States are not included in any of the PCE categories; these expenditures are recorded as exports in the NIPAs. Foreign residents’ expenditures for transportation within the United States are recorded in both exports and PCE for public transportation. 7 The classification system for PCE was introduced as part of the 2009 comprehensive update of the NIPAs.

Household consumption expenditures comprise purchases from business, government, and the rest of the world and from NPISHs (which are included in the health, recreation, education, and “other goods and services” categories). Final consumption expenditures of NPISHs are measured as gross output less own- account investment and less sales to households and other sectors (see the technical note). Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy. Thus, PCE represents the final demand for goods and services by households and NPISHs. In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, PCE appears in the Domestic Income and Product Account (Account 1), where it is the largest component of final demand, and in the Personal Income and Outlay Account (Account 3), where it is the dominant outlay. In the NIPAs, PCE by major type of product is presented in NIPA table group 2.3, and more detailed information by type of product is presented in NIPA table group 2.4.

The tables present nominal, or “current-dollar” measures, “real,” or inflation-adjusted measures, and price indexes. Additionally, BEA prepares “Underlying Detail Tables” for PCE by type of product that provide current-dollar, chained-dollar, and price estimates at a greater level of detail than are shown in the above tables. BEA does not include these detailed estimates in the published tables because their quality is significantly lower than that of the higher-level categories of which they are a part. In particular, these detailed estimates are more likely to be based on judgmental trends or on less reliable source data. Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier, the NIPA estimates, including those for PCE, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods”). For PCE, the estimates are based on statistical reports, primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau but also from other government agencies; on administrative and regulatory agency reports; and on reports from private organizations, such as trade associations. The following are among the principal source data used for the PCE estimates: BEA’s Benchmark Input-Output (I-O) Accounts, which are based primarily on the Census Bureau’s Economic Census, and BEA’s International Transactions Accounts; the Census Bureau’s Annual Retail Trade Survey, Service Annual Survey, Quarterly Services Survey, and Monthly Retail Trade Survey; and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Indexes (CPIs). Tables 5.A (PCE for goods) and 5.B (PCE for services) following the main text summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current- dollar benchmark, nonbenchmark, and current quarterly estimates and the quantity and price estimates for the categories of PCE as shown by type of product in NIPA table group 2.4. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Benchmark-year estimates The source data used for the PCE estimates are complete only for “benchmark” years— that is, years in which the benchmark I-O accounts are used to establish the level of PCE and of its components during a comprehensive update. The I-O accounts show the domestic output of each commodity and its disposition—either as intermediate consumption by industries or as",
    "tables": []

  "103": {
    "text": "CHAPTER 5: PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES 5-8 purchases by final users, including consumers. In the I-O accounts, PCE is presented as the sum of detailed commodities—goods and services—purchased by persons. 8 These commodities are then grouped into the PCE categories shown in the NIPA tables. 9 Two methods are used in preparing the benchmark estimates of PCE: commodity- flow and direct estimation. Direct estimates are made for the PCE categories that, by definition, are purchased only by persons: food furnished to employees (including the military and food produced and consumed on farms), standard clothing issued to military personnel, net expenditures abroad by U.S. residents, the rental value of owner- and tenant-occupied dwellings, services of workers employed by households, health insurance, and expense of handing life insurance and pension plans. In addition, direct estimates are made for expenditures in the United States by nonresidents—which include personal, business, and government expenditures and which are subtracted in their entirety in determining PCE. For most PCE categories, purchases by persons are estimated using the commodity-flow method (see the section “Commodity-flow method” in Chapter 4). Generally, this method begins with the value of domestic output based on data from the Economic Census—such as manufacturers’ shipments for most goods, revenue for utilities, receipts for most services, and commissions for securities brokerage. 10 Next, the domestic supply of each commodity—the amount available for domestic consumption— is estimated by adding imports and subtracting exports and inventory change. Then, this supply, denominated in producers’ prices, is allocated among domestic purchasers. The value of consumer purchases is then converted from producers’ prices to purchasers’ prices by adding wholesale margins and taxes, transportation costs, and retail margins and taxes. 11 For some categories, variations of this method are used. For new motor vehicles and for motor vehicle fuels, the domestic supply is converted to purchasers’ prices and then allocated among persons, business, and government based on trade source data. For electricity and for natural gas, residential revenue data provide direct estimates of purchases by persons. For prescription drugs, retail and health services sales from the Economic Census are allocated to PCE using Census Bureau data on sales by class of customer. For purchased meals and beverages (excluding school sales), food services sales from the Economic Census are allocated to PCE by type of eating place. 8 For more information on the preparation of the I-O benchmark accounts, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Concepts and Methods of the U.S. Input-Output Accounts, April 2009 available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 9 A complete listing of the commodities underlying each PCE product category is available in the FAQ “What is the I-O commodity composition of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) PCE categories?” 10 Three adjustments are made to the Economic Census data to bring the coverage of industries to levels that reflect all of their economic activities. The nonemployer adjustment extends the Economic Census coverage to establishments without employees or payrolls. The tax-misreporting adjustment corrects for the underreporting of income and for illegal nonfiling or late filing of tax returns. The tips or gratuity adjustment corrects for underreporting of receipts in certain industries, such as accommodation, food services, taxi services, and beauty salons.

    "text": "CHAPTER 5: PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES 5-9 Nonbenchmark-year estimates In years other than the benchmark years, the PCE estimates are mainly prepared using indicator series to represent the pattern of expenditures (see the section “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in Chapter 4). The estimates for most categories of PCE goods are prepared using the retail control method. The estimates for the remaining categories— motor vehicles; food furnished to employees; food produced and consumed on farms; tobacco; standard clothing issued to military personnel; motor vehicle fuels, lubricants, and fluids; and net expenditures abroad by U.S. residents—are prepared separately (see tables 5.A and 5.B; for motor vehicles and motor vehicle fuels, see also the technical note). The retail control method provides the indicator series used in interpolating and extrapolating the total for most goods, and it provides the “control total” to which the categories included in the retail control group must sum. This method is implemented as follows; for a general illustration of this method, see the section “Retail control method” in Chapter 4: 1. The estimate of total PCE for most goods is derived by extrapolation from the benchmark- year estimate using a retail control total of sales by most kinds of business from the annual retail trade survey. 2. The estimates for prescription drugs are prepared by extrapolation using data from IQVIA. 3. The estimates for audio discs, tapes, vinyl, and permanent digital downloads are prepared by extrapolation using data from the Recording Industry Association of America. 4. The estimates for the rest of the detailed PCE categories are prepared by extrapolation using estimates of retail sales by corresponding product lines that, in turn, are based on commodity sales data from the most recent Economic Census. For goods bought at grocery stores, the Economic Census allocations are updated annually through 2021 using retail point-of-sale scanner data from Circana, Inc. 12 For goods bought at electronics stores, the allocations are updated through 2022 using retail point-of-sale scanner data from Circana. 13 For goods bought at electronic shopping and mail order retailers, the allocations are updated using annual merchandise line sales from the Census Bureau E-commerce Report. 5. The expenditures estimates for the categories in step 4 are adjusted proportionately so that their sum plus the expenditures for prescription drugs and for audio discs, tapes, vinyl, and permanent digital downloads is equal to the retail control total in step 1. A variety of sources and methods are used to construct the indicator series for the PCE services categories. For many services, the service annual survey is the primary data source. Current quarterly and monthly estimates The seasonally adjusted current dollar quarterly and monthly estimates for most PCE categories are prepared by using seasonally adjusted indicator series to extrapolate from the annual estimates. Most goods categories are estimated by the retail control method using data on 12 See Eugene P. Seskin and Shelly Smith, “Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 88 (August 2008): 18. 13 See Clinton P.

For many services categories, the indicator series are based on data from the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Services Survey. For the remaining categories, the current estimates are extrapolated based on other source data or on judgmental trends. In general, the real-dollar series for these categories are extrapolated using the rate of change in population and a projected rate of change in real per capita consumption based on the results of the most recent NIPA annual update. The real-dollar estimates are then converted to current dollars using the appropriate monthly price indexes. The not seasonally adjusted estimates are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted estimates, using the not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators. Quantity and price estimates The estimates of quantities purchased, or real spending, for most of the detailed PCE categories are prepared by deflation. In this method, the quantities are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by an appropriate price index (with the reference-year value set to 100). For most PCE categories, the closest matching price index is a consumer price index or indexes. In addition, the quantity estimates for some detailed components are prepared by quantity extrapolation or by direct valuation. (For descriptions of the three methods, see the section “Estimates for detailed components” in Chapter 4.) The aggregate PCE measures are calculated from the detailed components as chain-type quantity and price indexes (for information about these calculations, see the section “Estimates for NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 4). BEA also prepares measures of real PCE and its components in a dollar-denominated form, designated “chained-dollar” estimates (see “Chained- dollar measures” in Chapter 4). 14 For the advance quarterly estimate, the source data for the third month are from the Census Bureau’s advance monthly retail sales survey because the MRTS data are not yet available.",

New motor vehicles The annual and quarterly estimates of PCE for new motor vehicles are derived by summing monthly estimates that are prepared separately for domestic autos, for foreign autos, for domestic light trucks, and for foreign light trucks. 15 The monthly estimates of the value of motor vehicle sales are derived as the number of units sold times the average expenditure per transaction, and the shares of these sales that are accounted for by persons are derived using information on new motor vehicle registrations. The data on monthly unit sales of autos and of light trucks (including vans and sport utility vehicles) are obtained from Wards Intelligence. The share of these sales that are accounted for by persons is derived from monthly data on new registrations by persons, government, and business from IHS-Polk. For autos, the business portion of “mixed-use” autos—that is, autos used both for business and personal use—is removed from sales to persons; this adjustment, which was initially based on data on business mileage driven by household members from a since-discontinued Census Bureau Current Population Survey (CPS) report, “Current Buying Indicators,” is updated annually to reflect changes in the ratio of self-employed persons to households based on CPS data. 16 For trucks, the share of sales to persons is benchmarked to information on the personal share of new truck purchases from the Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey in the Census Bureau’s Economic Census. For foreign autos, the share of sales to persons is equal to total unit sales less unit sales to business and government, which is estimated annually using data on business and total registrations. For domestic autos, sales to persons is equal to total unit sales to persons less foreign unit sales to persons. The estimates of average expenditure per transaction are derived from data on 15 In the NIPA estimates of PCE, sales of domestic motor vehicles consist of units assembled in the United States, Canada, and Mexico; sales of foreign motor vehicles are those assembled elsewhere. (In contrast, in the addenda to NIPA table group 7.2, “domestic output of new autos” refers only to autos assembled in the United States, and “sales of imported new autos” refers to autos assembled outside the United States.) 16 According to the international System of National Accounts, “when the owner of a business uses a vehicle partly for business purposes and partly for personal benefit, the expenditure on the purchase of the vehicle should be split between gross capital formation and household final consumption expenditures in proportion to its use for business and personal purposes.” See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008.",

Power and Associates. 17 Overall average expenditures are obtained using these detailed average transactions prices and the data on unit sales by model. For the current quarterly and monthly estimates, the business portion of “mixed-use” autos and the business portion of foreign car sales are held constant at the percentages for the most recent year, and the business portions of domestic autos and of light trucks are based on the monthly registrations data. For the advance quarterly estimate, 3 months of unit sales and price data and 2 months of registrations data are available; the business portions for the third month of the quarter are estimated by applying the previous month’s personal registration percentages by make to the third month’s sales by make. The estimates of real PCE for new motor vehicles are prepared by deflation. For autos, the CPI for new cars is used as the deflator; for trucks, the CPI for new trucks is used. 17 The make is the brand name of the vehicle (such as BMW or Chevrolet). The model is the classification of the vehicle as a particular variety within the same make (such as BMW 3-Series or Chevrolet Malibu). The trim level is the classification of the vehicle as a particular type within the same model (such as BMW 328i or Malibu 1LT).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 5: PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES 5-40 Net purchases of used motor vehicles In PCE, net purchases of used motor vehicles consist of dealers’ margins on purchases of these vehicles by persons and of net transactions between persons and other sectors of the economy. Net transactions for the personal sector are positive because persons buy more vehicles from the other sectors than they sell to those sectors; in contrast, net transactions for business are negative. 18 In calculating GDP, the intersectoral net transactions offset, leaving the margins on the transactions as value added. Separate estimates are made for used autos and for used light trucks. Dealers’ margins All purchases of used vehicles by persons from dealers include the retail margin— the difference between the selling price and the dealer’s cost of acquisition. Additionally, they may include a wholesale margin (for vehicles sold to dealers by wholesalers) and sales taxes that are collected by dealers on behalf of government. For benchmark years, total margins are estimated by applying margin rates and sales-tax rates to retail and wholesale sales of used motor vehicles. Then, the proportion of this total that applies to sales to persons is determined. 19 Retail and wholesale margin rates are estimated using data from the Census Bureau’s Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS) and Annual Wholesale Trade Survey (AWTS). Wholesale and retail sales of used motor vehicles are based on product-line sales data from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census. Sales taxes are calculated using data from the Census Bureau’s Census of Governments, from individual states on tax collections, from ARTS, and from AWTS. For autos, almost all the margin is allocated to sales to persons; for light trucks, the allocation to persons is based on information from the Census Bureau’s Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey. For nonbenchmark years, retail and wholesale margins are extrapolated using Census Bureau’s gross margins for used car dealers and wholesale margins excluding Manufacturers’ Sales Branches and Offices (MSBOs) for motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and supplies, respectively.

For the most recent year, total retail and wholesale margins are extrapolated using Census Bureau’s retail sales of used car dealers and wholesale sales except MSBOs for motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and supplies, respectively.

The current quarterly and monthly estimates of margins on used autos and used light trucks are extrapolated from the annual estimates using data on retail sales of used car dealers from the monthly retail trade survey. The estimates of real margins are prepared by deflation, using the CPI for used cars and trucks. Net transactions Net transactions between persons and other sectors of the economy primarily consist of the wholesale value of purchases by persons from dealers less sales by persons to dealers (either directly or as trade-ins).20 In addition, transactions may occur between persons and businesses other than dealers (such as the sale of scrapped vehicles), government, and nonresidents. Transactions among persons are intra-sectoral and so do not affect PCE. For benchmark years, purchases of used motor vehicles by persons from dealers is estimated as (1) dealer sales less (2) exports less (3) dealers’ margins, (4) split into purchases by persons and by business. Dealer sales are from the Economic Census merchandise line data, adjusted to include sales taxes using data from the ARTS; exports are from Census’ Foreign Trade Statistics and BEA’s Balance of Payments Division; dealers’ margins is from the ARTS; and the split is based on information from 2012 Economic Census of Retail Trade Class of Customer data and BEA’s Government Expenditure data. Sales of used motor vehicles by persons to dealers is estimated as (1) dealer sales less (2) dealers’ margin plus (3) the change in dealers’ inventories of used motor vehicles, (4) split into sales by persons and by business. The change in dealer inventories is based on inventory data from the ARTS; the split between sales by persons and by business is based on data from 2012 Economic Census of Retail Trade Class of Customer data and BEA’s Government Expenditure data. For nonbenchmark years, estimates of net transactions are developed by valuing the annual change in unit stocks of used motor vehicles held by persons, rather than by explicitly taking into account each type of transaction listed above. Yearend unit stocks of used autos and of used light trucks are estimated for each year of original sale (vehicles greater than 11 years old are grouped together) using annual data on new motor vehicle purchases and retention information developed from IHS-Polk data on vehicles in use by model year. 21 Unit stocks held by business are based on business 20 For autos, net purchases also includes reimbursement of government employees for use of personal autos on government business. 21 The year of original sale is the year in which the vehicle was sold as new. Thus, for example, the stock of used autos at yearend 2007 consists of all new autos that were sold in 2007, all new autos that were sold in 2006 and were not subsequently scrapped or otherwise disposed, and so on.",

Unit stocks held by government are based on government purchases of new vehicles and on assumed retention rates. Stocks held by persons are then calculated as the residual. Changes in the unit stocks of autos and of light trucks held by persons reflect purchases of new vehicles, scrappage of old vehicles, and net unit transactions other than scrappage. Purchases of new autos and of light trucks by persons are estimated separately (see the section “New motor vehicles”). Scrapped units are calculated by age of vehicle as a proportion of total vehicle scrappage; this proportion is assumed to be equal to the ratio of the unit stock held by persons to the total unit stock. Net unit transactions other than scrappage is then calculated as the residual. The changes in unit stocks, grouped by age, are then valued at wholesale prices. The average wholesale value for each age group of used autos and of used light trucks is based on average used auto and used light truck prices by model year from National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA).

The product line for automotive fuels is comprised of: • Unleaded regular gasoline • Unleaded mid-grade gasoline • Unleaded premium gasoline • Diesel fuel • Other automotive fuels The product line for diesel fuel is used to estimate total diesel gasoline consumption; the portion of this consumption that is accounted for by households is based on judgmental analysis of various source data. The remaining product lines for automotive fuels are used to estimate total non-diesel gasoline and other motor fuel consumption. The portion of this consumption that is accounted for by households is based on the Census Bureau’s Class of Customer data from the Economic Census and judgmental analysis of various other source data. Aviation gasoline or air fuel is also included in this estimate; fuel purchased for airplanes is calculated as total gallons of gasoline consumed for aviation (which excludes jet fuel) from the Federal Highway Administration times a consumer share based on Federal Aviation Administration data on the proportion of hours flown in general aviation use that is accounted for by personal use. Nonbenchmark-year estimates Nonbenchmark-year estimates of PCE for gasoline and other motor fuel are prepared by separately extrapolating PCE for non-diesel gasoline and PCE for diesel gasoline from the preceding annual estimate and then summing the two estimates. PCE for non-diesel gasoline is extrapolated based on data on the quantity of gasoline supplied from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) times the CPI for motor fuel from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). PCE for diesel gasoline is based on the BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) data on household purchases of diesel fuel, when available.

The housing stock provides a flow of housing services that are consumed by persons who rent their housing and by persons who own the housing they occupy (referred to as “owner-occupants”). In the NIPAs, owner- occupants are treated as owning unincorporated enterprises that provide housing services to themselves in the form of the rental value of their dwellings. 22 Thus, PCE for housing services includes both the monetary rents paid by tenants and an imputed rental value for owner-occupied dwellings (measured as the income the homeowner could have received if the house had been rented to a tenant).23 This treatment is designed to make PCE (and GDP) invariant to whether the house is rented by a landlord to a tenant or is lived in by the homeowner. 24 Measures of PCE for the services provided by tenant-occupied housing are based on data on rent paid by tenants and data on the number of tenant-occupied units, both from the American Community Survey’s (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS).25 For measures of PCE for the services provided by owner-occupied housing, estimates of rent per unit are derived using the rental equivalence approach, adjusted to include an “owner premium,” based on the same ACS data. Within nonfarm properties, the NIPAs provide separate estimates for owner- occupied permanent-site dwellings, owner-occupied mobile homes, tenant-occupied permanent-site dwellings, and tenant-occupied mobile homes. Within farm properties, separate estimates are prepared for tenant-occupied dwellings and owner-occupied dwellings.26 22 This treatment is consistent with that of the international System of National Accounts (SNA): “Households that own the dwellings they occupy are formally treated as owners of unincorporated enterprises that produce housing services consumed by those same households” See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008: 6:117 at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/SNA2008.asp. 23 The income earned from the rental of housing, including the provision of owner-occupied housing services, is reflected in the NIPA measure of rental income of persons. For more information on this measure, see “Chapter 12: Rental Income of Persons.” 24 According to the SNA, “The ratio of owner-occupied to rented dwellings can vary significantly…so both international and inter-temporal comparisons of the production and consumption of housing services could be distorted if no imputation were made for the value of own-account housing services.” (SNA 2008: 6.34). 25 BEA uses “1-year” ACS data; that is, data that are collected over 12 months of a calendar year. 1-year data are collected for areas with populations of 65,000 or more. The ACS provides both “1-year” estimates “5-year” estimates (collected over five calendar years). For more information on the ACS single- and multi-year estimates, see Chapter 3 of the Census Bureau’s “Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know.” 26 The ACS identifies farms as properties with agricultural sales greater than $1,000 per year.",

Payments for utilities also excluded because they are already accounted for elsewhere in PCE. Rents per unit are weighted averages of actual observations of tenant-occupied unit rents that are covered by the ACS, adjusted to exclude utilities where necessary. For owner-occupied dwellings, the rental value is estimated using the rental equivalence approach paired with an owner premium. That is, for each year and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) in the ACS, a stratified rental equivalence for owner units is imputed by regressing tenant rents, from which utilities have been excluded, on characteristics of tenant units reported in the ACS.27 Characteristics include structure type, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and age of structure. ACS data on the same characteristics of owner-occupied units are then applied to the parameter estimates from the tenant regressions to calculate the imputed rental value for owner-occupied units. These imputations are done at the unit level. The imputed rental values for owner-occupied units are then adjusted to include an “owner premium” to adjust for quality differences between owner-occupied and tenant-occupied units. The owner premium is particularly important for accurately reflecting the value of housing services for high-valued homes, as they are not well- represented in rental markets. The adjustment generally results in a higher rent per unit for a given combination of housing characteristics compared with a tenant-occupied unit. For the most recent year, estimates are released before the ACS data become available; consequently, measures of rent per unit are judgmentally extrapolated using recent years’ growth trends and any relevant topical information. Number of housing units For annual estimates except the most recent year, for all tenure categories, the number of housing units are derived from ACS observations and aggregated to the national level from PUMA data. Where the ACS classifies a housing unit as a mobile unit with agricultural sales greater than $1,000, BEA classifies that unit as owner- or tenant-occupied farm housing. Mobile units are defined to include any housing unit used as a principal 27A PUMA is a Census Bureau statistical geographic area defined for the dissemination of PUMS data.

Current quarterly and monthly estimates Quarterly and monthly current-dollar estimates are prepared by reﬂating the estimates of real PCE for each type of dwelling using the CPI for rent of primary residence for tenant-occupied dwellings and the CPI for owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence for owner-occupied dwellings. The monthly estimates in real terms are based on the number of units for each type of dwelling adjusted for changes in the quality of the housing stock. Stocks of permanent-site homes are interpolated and extrapolated from the annual estimates, using monthly Census Bureau data on housing completions. The total stock of mobile homes is estimated by interpolating and extrapolating from the annual estimates, using monthly Census Bureau data on shipments of manufactured homes (for the advance quarterly estimate, the shipments data are available only for the first 2 months of the quarter).

The unit estimates are adjusted for changes in the quality of the housing stock based on historical relationships between average rental values and the respective CPIs. Quantity estimates The estimates of the real rental value of tenant-occupied nonfarm dwellings are derived by deflation: the CPI for rent of primary residence is used to deflate space rent, and the CPI for major appliances is used to deflate depreciation at current-replacement costs of major appliances and furnishings provided by property owners. The estimates of the real rental value of owner-occupied nonfarm dwellings are derived by deflation using the CPI for owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence. 28 Imputed rents for vacant units do not include an owner premium adjustment because the information on values that is required to derive the premium is not available for all categories of vacant units.",

In the NIPAs, imputations are made for the value of the services (such as check clearing, recordkeeping, and investment services) that are provided by depository institutions.35 For commercial banks and other depository institutions, services to borrowers are estimated as the difference between the rate of return on loans and a riskless “reference rate”—measured as the average rate earned by banks on U.S. government and agency securities 36—times the value of loans that involve direct customer contact. 37 Services to depositors are estimated as the difference between the reference rate and the rate paid on deposits times the value of deposits that involve direct customer contact. These estimates are based on the premise that rather than pay explicit fees, borrowers accept a higher interest rate, and depositors a lower rate, than they would otherwise. The differences in interest rates are used to infer the implicit value of the services that the banks are providing to their customers. Interest flows are adjusted because a portion of the money paid as interest by borrowers represents a payment for these services and because the interest forgone by depositors reflects the value of the services they receive. 33 The value of these services to government is imputed to government consumption expenditures and that to foreigners is imputed to exports of services. For business, these services are considered intermediate consumption and cancel out in the consolidation of the production account of the business sector. 34 Rental income is also earned by pension plans, but this amount is assumed to be small. 35 See Brent R. Moulton and Eugene P. Seskin, “Preview of the 2003 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 83 (June 2003): 23–27; see also Dennis J. Fixler, Marshall B. Reinsdorf, and George M.

In personal outlays, PCE is raised by the sum of the imputed service charges for depositor and investor services and for borrower services, and personal interest payments is reduced by the imputed service charges for borrower services, since a portion of the interest payment is assumed to represent a fee for unpriced borrower services. Thus, personal outlays is raised by the same amount as personal interest income, and personal savings is not affected by the imputations. In the NIPAs, pension plans are regarded as charging participants an implicit fee that is equal to the plans’ administrative expenses for the package of imputed services provided. The property income of pension plans is recorded in personal income as monetary interest, as imputed interest on unfunded liabilities, and as dividends, and the difference between this property income and the imputed fees is included in personal savings.

The value of the implicit service is calculated by applying the user-cost price to the average deposit or loan balance, with an adjustment to include balances in U.S. offices of foreign banks. Imputed services to depositors are equal to the sum of services to all types of deposit accounts—demand deposit accounts (noninterest-bearing checkable deposits) and interest-bearing accounts (checkable deposit accounts, savings accounts, and time deposit accounts)—except intrabank deposits. The share of total imputed demand-deposit services that is allocated to persons is based on the share of demand deposits held by persons. This share was initially based on a since-discontinued Federal Reserve Board (FRB) survey of demand deposit ownership. The personal share of demand deposits is no longer available, so the original estimate from the FRB survey is extrapolated using the household share of transactions deposits (which include interest-bearing checkable deposits as well as demand deposits) as follows. FFIEC data on total transactions deposits in domestic offices are adjusted to exclude deposits held by commercial banks and other depository institutions, and deposits held by individuals, partnerships, and corporations are calculated as a percentage of the adjusted total. FRB Financial Accounts of the U.S. data on the distribution of checkable accounts among households and types of business are then used to determine the household share of the adjusted transactions deposits. For interest-bearing deposits, there are no data on the share of these deposits held by persons, so the allocation of implicit services to persons is based on the household share of interest-bearing deposits excluding checkable deposits (which include money market deposit accounts, other savings deposits, and time deposits) derived from FFIEC and flow of funds data. The FFIEC total of these deposits is adjusted to exclude holdings of foreign governments and official institutions, and the percentage of deposits held by individuals, partnerships, and corporations is calculated. Flow of funds data on the distribution of savings and time deposits among households and types of businesses are then used to determine the household share of the adjusted deposits total.

These institutions earn property income (dividend, interest, and rental income) on insurance reserves that have been contributed directly by, or are held for the benefit of, policy holders and that will be paid out to the beneficiaries as annuity or lump-sum distributions of income in the future. In the NIPAs, life insurance carriers are regarded as charging policyholders an imputed fee that is equal to the institutions’ operating expenses for the package of services provided. The imputations for the value of these services are recorded in the Personal Income and Outlay Account of the summary NIPAs as follows. 41 • The imputed fees are treated as personal outlays and are recorded as “life insurance” in PCE. • The property income of life insurance carriers is recorded as “imputed interest received from life insurance carriers” in personal interest income. The underwriting income of life insurance carriers (premiums less benefits) is treated as a transfer payment within the personal sector; such intra-sectoral transactions are not recorded in the NIPAs. • The savings of life insurance carriers is consolidated with that of the personal sector.

Commissions paid on premiums and annuity considerations, which measure only commissions on direct insurance business, are adjusted to a measure of total net commissions paid by adding commissions paid on reinsurance assumed and by subtracting commissions received on reinsurance ceded. Because the annual statements of domestic companies consolidate their activities worldwide, the expenses of their operations in foreign countries must be subtracted in order to derive expenses chargeable to U.S. residents. In addition, the expenses of foreign life insurance companies operating in the United States must be added. Benchmark estimates of the expenses of domestic companies abroad are estimated using the relationship between domestic premium receipts and total premium receipts from the American Council of Life Insurers’ (ACLI) Life Insurance Fact Book. Benchmark estimates of the expenses of foreign companies operating in the United States are estimated by calculating the ratio of U.S. residents’ premium payments to Canadian companies to their payments to U.S. companies, based on ACLI Fact Book, and applying this ratio to the expenses of domestic companies chargeable to U.S. residents.

    "text": "CHAPTER 5: PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES 5-63 Property and casualty insurance Property and casualty insurance comprises three PCE services components: net household insurance, private workers’ compensation, and net motor vehicle and other transportation insurance. Household insurance consists of the following lines of insurance: homeowners’ multiple peril, farm owners’ multiple peril, inland marine, 42 and earthquake. Private workers’ compensation consists of insurance provided by commercial companies and of self-insurance by employers. Motor vehicle insurance consists of private passenger auto liability and private passenger auto physical damage. Property and casualty insurance companies provide three types of financial services to policyholders: • risk-pooling services, which enable consumers and others exposed to property and casualty losses to reduce their individual risk; • loss-related services—such as loss settlements, risk surveys, and loss prevention plans; and • intermediation services, whereby policyholders earn property income (interest, dividend, and rental income) on the investment of funds in “technical reserves,” which consist of premiums paid by policyholders in advance of coverage periods and of casualty losses incurred by insurers but not yet disbursed to policyholders. 43 In the NIPAs, the three types of property and casualty insurance services are each measured as total premiums less “normal” losses incurred. Total premiums consist of premiums earned plus “premium supplements” less dividends payable to policyholders. Premiums are paid directly by policyholders and are earned by the insurers during the risk period covered. Premium supplements equal the expected investment income on technical reserves, including capital gains. According to the SNA, “the insurance company invests the premium, and the property income is an extra source of funds to meet any claim due. The property income represents income foregone by the client and so is treated as an implicit supplement to the actual premium.” 44 The NIPA measure of insurance services recognizes that in most periods, the insurance premiums received and the investment income earned provide the funds needed by insurance companies for a normal, or expected, level of insurance claims and insurance services and for additions to reserves. In setting their premiums, these companies do not yet know the actual loss in the period; thus, an estimate of normal losses—that is, the losses that insurers expect to pay—rather than actual losses is used in calculating the value of insurance services.45 Expected losses are estimated using a model 42 Inland marine insurance consists of coverage of goods transported by land and of transportable business property and personal property (such as bicycles, furs, and jewelry). 43 Technical reserves are funds on which policyholders have a legal claim, so they are recognized as assets belonging to them.

Under this treatment, actual losses less normal losses, referred to as “net insurance settlements,” reflect the net value of the transfer-like flows between the policyholders and the insurance companies. 46 Net insurance settlements consist of disaster-related losses and of other net insurance settlements. 47 In the absence of the imputations for premium supplements and normal losses, property and casualty insurance services would be measured as direct premiums earned less actual losses incurred and dividends to policyholders. However, policyholders pay a smaller premium than they would in the absence of investment income, so premiums alone do not fully account for the cost of insurance services. In addition, the use of actual losses would result in a volatile measure of insurance services because of the large swings in insurance payments that result from catastrophic losses. This treatment is consistent with that recommended in the SNA, in which non-life insurance output is measured as “total premiums earned, plus premium supplements, less adjusted claims incurred,” which are defined as the claims that the insurance company expects to pay. 48 The treatment of property and casualty insurance services provided to persons is recorded in the Personal Income and Outlay Account of the summary NIPAs as follows. 49 • The insurance services are treated as personal outlays and are recorded in PCE according to the type of insurance provided. • The expected investment income on technical reserves (premium supplements) of the insurance categories in PCE is classified as imputed interest and included in personal interest income (a part of personal income receipts on assets in personal income). • PCE for the premium supplements and the associated imputed personal interest income are both raised by the same amount, so personal saving is not affected. • Private workers’ compensation premiums, entirely paid by employers and including self-insurance, are included in employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds (a part of supplements to wages and salaries in personal income).

However, these flows are similar to transfers in that they reflect the part of the payments that are not associated with the purchase of insurance services, so they are included in business transfer payments in the NIPAs. 47 In the 2009 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, BEA changed the treatment of disasters to better reflect the distinctions between current transactions, capital transactions, and events that directly affect balance sheets and to bring the NIPAs in line with the recently updated SNA.

Seskin and Shelly Smith, “Preview of the 2009 Comprehensive Revision of the NIPAs: Changes in Definitions and Presentations,” Survey 89 (March 2009): 11–15. 48 SNA 2008: 6.185–6.189. 49 For a discussion of the summary NIPAs, see Chapter 2.",

Best Company on direct premiums earned, direct losses incurred, net investment income, and dividends to policyholders. For each line of insurance included in PCE, normal loss ratios are derived for each year as the exponentially weighted moving average of the actual loss ratios—that is, the ratio of actual direct losses incurred to direct premiums earned—of past years. For insurance lines affected by catastrophic losses, the years for which loss ratios are affected are treated as missing observations in the calculation of the normal loss ratios. The catastrophic loss is then computed as the difference between the actual loss ratio and the normal loss ratio applied to direct premiums earned, and the catastrophic loss is spread forward equally over 20 years. Normal losses for each year are derived as the normal loss ratio multiplied by direct premiums earned. Similarly, the expected investment income ratio for each year is derived as the exponentially weighted moving average of the investment income to premiums ratios of past years.51 Premium supplements for each year are then derived as the expected investment income ratio multiplied by the direct premiums earned. Once data for premium supplements and normal losses are derived, these data and the A.M. Best data on direct premiums and dividends paid are used to derive total insurance services for each line of insurance. Because the A.M. Best data cover the consolidated worldwide operations of U.S. insurance companies, insurance operations in foreign countries must be excluded from total insurance services; this adjustment is accomplished by using A.M. Best data on direct business in foreign locations, by line of insurance. Data on total imports of property and casualty insurance are from BEA’s International Transactions Accounts; the total is separated out by line based on the distribution of property and casualty insurance reflected in BEA’s Benchmark Input- Output (I-O) Accounts for the United States, which are released approximately every 5 years. Distributions by line of insurance are derived by straight-line interpolation for the years between I-O benchmarks and are held constant for the years following the most recent benchmark.

Because NPISHs produce services that are not generally sold at market prices, the value of these services is measured as the costs incurred in producing them. In PCE, the value of a household purchase of a service that is provided by a NPISH consists of the price paid by the household or on behalf of the household for that service plus the value added by the NPISH that is not included in the price. For example, the value of the educational services provided to a student by a university consists of the tuition fee paid by the household to the university and of the additional services that are funded by sources other than tuition fees (such as by the returns to an endowment fund). NPISHs are accounted for in PCE by their “final consumption expenditures,” which equal their gross output less sales to other sectors of the economy (such as sales of education services to employers) and less sales to households. The gross output of NPISHs is equal to their current operating expenses less sales to households that are not related to the NPISHs’ primary activity (such as room and board charges by colleges and universities). Operating expenses consist of compensation costs, purchased goods and services except for capital outlays, and the imputed rental value of structures and equipment owned by NPISHs. Capital outlays consist of the value of purchased buildings and of equipment and software as well as the value of investment goods such as software that are produced directly by the NPISHs. The imputed rental value of structures and of equipment and software owned by NPISHs equals the sum of interest paid, depreciation at current replacement cost, and property taxes. Sales of services by NPISHs to households are subtracted from the NPISH expenses because these sales are accounted for in household consumption expenditures in PCE. In the PCE tables, NPISH final expenditures are not distributed among the individual categories but are shown as a separate entry. NPISH sales of services to households are accounted for in the following PCE categories: • Health o Outpatient services o Hospitals o Nursing homes • Recreation o Membership clubs and participant sports centers o Performing arts o Museums and libraries o Other recreation services • Education o Higher education o Nursery, elementary, and secondary schools o Commercial and vocational schools",

The benchmark estimates of elementary and secondary schools expenses are based on NCES estimates of total expenditures adjusted from a school-year basis to a calendar-year basis and adjusted to exclude capital outlays, scholarships and fellowships, and unrelated sales and to include in-kind wages and depreciation valued at current replacement cost.

For 2011 forward, the annual estimates are extrapolated using Giving USA’s Annual Report of Philanthropy. The benchmark estimates for labor organizations expenses are based on total industry wages from the QCEW, to which is applied a ratio of expenses to wages and salaries from IRS data on labor, agriculture, and horticultural organizations. A ratio of membership dues to wages and salaries from the IRS data is applied to QCEW wages to derive sales of labor organizations. The annual estimates are extrapolated using QCEW wage data. The benchmark and annual estimates of political organization expenditures are based on data on disbursements for Federal elections from the Federal Election Commission and independent expenditures for national office data as well as state and local election spending data from OpenSecrets.org. Current quarterly estimates For most categories of NPISHs, the third current quarterly estimate is based on expenses and receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Services Survey. The second and advance estimates are based primarily on CES data on employment, hours, and earnings: for categories other than education, a wages and salaries indicator equal to total employment times average weekly hours times average hourly earnings is used; for education categories, CES total employment times the all-items CPI is used. Quantity estimates The estimates of the real gross output of NPISHs are prepared by deflation using input cost indexes. These indexes are weighted averages of indexes of compensation costs and indexes of the prices of purchased goods and services. The weights for the indexes are based on BEA’s Benchmark Input-Output estimates. For compensation costs, the indexes are based on CES data on average hourly earnings, except for the indexes for hospitals and nursing homes, which are based on the BLS Employment Cost Index, and the indexes for education categories, which are extrapolated using the CPI for education services. For purchased materials and services, PPIs and CPIs are used for the associated expenses, and for expenses that cannot be associated with specific price indexes, the all- items less food and energy CPI is used.",

Fixed assets consist of structures, equipment, and intellectual property products that are used in the production of goods and services. PFI encompasses the creation of new productive assets, the improvement of existing assets, and the replacement of worn out or obsolete assets. The PFI estimates serve as an indicator of the willingness of private businesses and nonprofit institutions to expand their production capacity and as an indicator of the demand for housing. Thus, movements in PFI serve as a barometer of confidence in, and support for, future economic growth. PFI also provides comprehensive information on the composition of business fixed investment. Thus, for example, it can be used to assess the penetration of new technology. In addition, the investment estimates are the building blocks for BEA’s estimates of capital stock, which are used in measuring rates of return on capital and in analyzing multifactor productivity. The PFI estimates are an integral part of the U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts”). The PFI estimates are also a primary element of BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts.1 1 For a description of the methodology for BEA’s estimates of the stocks and depreciation of fixed assets and of the investment flows used to derive them, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States 1925–97, September 2003.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-2 Definitions and Concepts PFI is a measure of the additions to, and replacements of, the U.S. stock of private fixed assets. As noted in Chapter 2, fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in the production process—that is, in the production of other goods (including other fixed assets) or of services—for more than 1 year. Table 6.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, PFI. The bulk of PFI consists of capital expenditures by private business—including expenditures on new structures, equipment, and intellectual property products; net transactions in used assets; and own-account production (production by a business for its own use) of structures, equipment, and intellectual property products.2 PFI also includes capital expenditures by nonprofit institutions serving households, and it includes capital expenditures for the acquisition of new residential structures and for improvements to existing residential structures by households in their capacity as owner-occupants.3 In the NIPAs, the construction of a new house (excluding the value of the unimproved land) is treated as an investment, the ownership of the house (regardless of whether the residence is owner- or tenant-occupied) is treated as a productive business enterprise, and a service is assumed to flow over its economic life from the house to the occupant.4 However, as noted in Chapter 2, purchases of durable goods by persons are treated as personal consumption expenditures rather than as capital expenditures. 2 In the NIPAs, private business consists of all corporate and noncorporate businesses that are organized for profit, other entities that produce goods and services for sale at a price that is based on the costs of production, and certain other private entities that are treated as business in the NIPAs. These other entities include mutual financial institutions, private noninsured pension funds, cooperatives, nonprofit organizations that primarily serve business (that is, entities classified as nonprofit by the Internal Revenue Service in determining income tax liability), federal reserve banks, and federally sponsored credit agencies. 3 Capital expenditures by government enterprises are included in gross investment by government. 4 This treatment is consistent with that of the international System of National Accounts (SNA): “Households that own the dwellings they occupy are formally treated as owners of unincorporated enterprises that produce housing services consumed by those same households.” See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008: 6:117 at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/SNA2008.asp.

However, there are certain cases for which the NIPA treatment differs from that used in business-tax-accounting. For example, the exploration and drilling costs associated with unsuccessful drilling activities (“dry” holes) are treated as expenses by the petroleum industry but as investment in the NIPAs. In addition, business-accounting practices may differ from one industry to another, from one period to another, or from one type of asset to another. For example, some businesses may expense the purchase of certain types of software, while others may capitalize it; for consistency, all software purchases are treated as investment in the NIPAs. These capitalization rules and the selection of commodities that are treated as fixed assets are reviewed and updated as part of the preparation of BEA’s benchmark input-output (I-O) accounts and of comprehensive updates of the NIPAs. As part of the 2013 comprehensive NIPA revision, BEA fully integrated the 2007 benchmark input- output accounts and introduced several substantial changes that expanded the definition of fixed assets. First, BEA began treating expenditures by business, government, and nonprofit institutions serving households on research and development as fixed investment.5 Second, it began treating expenditures by business and nonprofit institutions serving households on entertainment, literary, and other artistic originals as fixed investment. These changes recognize that these intangible assets have ownership rights, are long-lasting, and are used in the production process. Investment in research and development and in entertainment originals, along with that in software (which has been treated as a fixed asset since the 1999 comprehensive NIPA revision), is shown in the NIPAs in the subcategory “intellectual property products” in nonresidential fixed investment.6 Also as part of the 2013 comprehensive update, BEA expanded the ownership transfer costs of residential fixed assets to include all of the nonfinancial ownership transfer costs that are associated with the purchase of a residential asset (such as title insurance; title, abstract, and attorney fees; payments for state and local government documentary and stamp taxes; and payments for surveys and engineering services).7 As part of the 2018 comprehensive update, BEA began including the value of the return to fixed capital (that is, capital services) into estimates of private fixed investment in own-account software and in own-account R&D beginning with 2007. The improved treatment is consistent with international standards and will provide more 5 The treatment of these expenditures as investment provides another example in which economic accounting differs from business accounting; see Dylan G. Rassier, “BEA Briefing: Treatment of Research and Development in Economic Accounts and in Business Accounts,” Survey of Current Business 94 (March 2014): 1–8. 6For more information, see “Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: Changes in Definitions and Presentations,” Survey 93 (March 2013): 14–21. 7 Expenses associated with financing a purchase of a residential asset, such as loan origination fees, credit reports, and adjustment and collection expenses, continue to be recorded as current expenses, because these expenses represent financial services and are not necessary to purchase a dwelling.",

The NIPA measure of PFI records capital expenditures on structures in the United States regardless of whether the structure is U.S.-owned or foreign-owned.8 It records capital expenditures on equipment and software in the United States regardless of whether the equipment and software are domestically produced or imported. In contrast, capital expenditures by U.S. residents on structures in other countries and U.S. exports of equipment and software are excluded from the PFI measure. In the NIPAs, the broadest measure of PFI is gross private fixed investment. It is measured without deduction of consumption of fixed capital (CFC), which is a measure of capital used up in production. Gross private fixed investment less CFC equals net private fixed investment. Gross private fixed investment comprises nonresidential fixed investment in structures, equipment, and intellectual property products and residential fixed investment in structures and equipment. Nonresidential structures consists of new construction—including own-account construction;9 improvements to existing structures;10 expenditures on new mobile structures; expenditures on mining exploration, shafts, and wells;11 brokers’ commissions on sales of structures;12 and net purchases of used structures by private businesses and by nonprofit institutions from government agencies.13 In addition, it includes equipment that is considered to be an integral part of the structure (such as plumbing, heating, and electrical systems). Nonresidential equipment consists of purchases by private businesses and by nonprofit institutions of new equipment (such as machinery, furniture, and motor vehicles) that meets the above definition of a fixed asset. It also includes dealers’ margins on sales of used equipment to businesses and to nonprofit institutions; net purchases of used equipment from government agencies, from persons, and from the rest of the world; and own-account production of equipment. It is measured net of the value of worn out equipment sold for scrap. 8 Ownership of a structure in a country signifies a long-term economic interest in that country, and thus the owner is considered a resident of that country. 9 For nonresidential fixed investment, own-account construction consists of the value of construction materials supplied by the project owner and the value of the labor supplied by the owner’s own construction employees assigned to the project. 10 Improvements to nonresidential structures are included with new construction but are not separately identified. 11 In principle, mining exploration should be classified as part of intellectual property products, but currently these expenditures cannot be separately identified due to source data limitations. 12 These commissions are considered part of the total price paid by the purchaser for the structure and thus are counted as part of the value of investment. 13 These transactions are included so that private and government ownership of the net stock of fixed assets is properly recorded; by definition, such transfers net to zero and do not affect gross domestic product.",

Entertainment originals includes theatrical movies, long-lived television programs, books, music, and other artistic originals that are used to produce copies for the public. Residential structures consists of new construction of permanent-site single- family and multifamily housing units, improvements (additions, alterations, and major structural replacements) to housing units,14 expenditures on manufactured homes, brokers’ commissions and other ownership transfer costs15 on the sale of residential property, and net purchases of used structures from government agencies. Residential structures also includes some types of equipment (such as heating and air conditioning equipment) that are built into the structure. Residential equipment consists of equipment, such as furniture or household appliances, that is purchased by landlords for rental to tenants. Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy. PFI represents the final demand for structures, for equipment, and for intellectual property products by private businesses and by other entities that are treated similarly to businesses in the NIPAs. In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, PFI appears in the Domestic Income and Product Account (account 1) as the dominant component of gross private domestic investment and in the Domestic Capital Account (account 6) as the dominant component of gross domestic investment. In the NIPAs, PFI is shown by type of product classification rather than by industry classification. Annual estimates of gross fixed investment and net fixed investment (that is, investment less CFC) by major type are provided in NIPA table group 5.2. PFI by type is presented in NIPA table group 5.3.

They include major replacements—such as new roofs, water heaters, furnaces, and central air conditioners—that prolong the expected life of the structure or add to its value; routine maintenance and repair work is not included. For residential fixed investment, own-account construction (“do-it-yourself” projects) consists of the value of the materials supplied only and does not include the value of the labor supplied by the property owner. 15 Ownership transfer costs includes title insurance; title, abstract, and attorney fees; payments for state and local government documentary and stamp taxes; and payments for surveys and engineering services.

In addition, estimates of PFI by industry and by legal form of organization are presented as part of BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts.17 Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier, the NIPA estimates, including those for PFI, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods”). For PFI, the estimates are based on government statistical reports, primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau but also from other federal government agencies, and on reports from private organizations, such as trade associations. The following are among the principal source data used for the PFI estimates: BEA’s benchmark I-O accounts, which are primarily based on the Census Bureau’s Economic Census, and BEA’s International Transactions Accounts; the Census Bureau’s annual and monthly Survey of Manufacturers, monthly construction statistics, monthly foreign trade data, the Service Annual Survey, and the Quarterly Services Survey; the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) monthly Current Employment Statistics, Producer Price Indexes (PPIs) and Import Price Indexes; and National Science Foundation’s (NSF) surveys of research and development and innovation. Table 6.A (investment in structures), table 6.B (investment in equipment), and table 6.C (investment in intellectual property products) at the end of this chapter summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current- dollar benchmark, nonbenchmark, and current quarterly estimates and the quantity and price indexes for the detailed categories shown by type in NIPA table groups 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6.

    "text": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-9 Benchmark-year estimates For benchmark years, BEA’s benchmark I-O accounts are used to establish the levels of PFI and its components. The I-O accounts show the domestic output of each commodity and its disposition—either as intermediate consumption by industries or as purchases for final use, including business investment. In the I-O accounts, PFI is presented as the sum of detailed commodities purchased by business for final use.18 These commodities are then grouped into the PFI categories shown in the NIPA tables.19 For structures, the benchmark I-O estimates are primarily based on detailed value- put-in-place data from the Census Bureau’s monthly survey of construction spending. The “value of construction put in place” is defined as the value of construction installed or erected at the construction site during a given period, regardless of when the work on the project was started or completed, when the structure was sold or delivered, or when payment for the structure was made.20 BEA adjusts the value-put-in-place data to account for coverage gaps that are implied by comparing these data with those from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census.21 In addition, BEA uses data from other government sources and from trade sources in estimating the following structures categories: mobile structures; oil and natural gas well drilling and exploration; other mining exploration, shafts, and wells; residential manufactured homes; brokers’ commissions on the sale of nonresidential structures and brokers’ commissions and other ownership transfer costs on the sale of residential structures; and net purchases of used structures from government agencies. For equipment, the benchmark estimates are largely prepared using the commodity-flow method (for a general description of this method, see “Commodity-flow method” in Chapter 4). This method, which is implemented in its most complete form in preparing the benchmark I-O accounts, generally begins with a value of domestic output (principally manufacturers’ shipments) based on detailed data from the Economic Census. Next, the domestic supply of each commodity—the amount available for domestic consumption—is estimated by adding imports and subtracting exports, both based on the Census Bureau’s international trade data. The domestic supply is then allocated among domestic purchasers—business, government, and consumers. For most commodities, the allocation of purchases to business, and the subsequent allocation of 18 For more information on the preparation of the I-O benchmark accounts, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Concepts and Methods of the U.S. Input-Output Accounts, April 2009, available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 19 A complete listing of the commodities underlying each category of PFI in equipment is available as part of an FAQ available on BEA’s website: “Are more detailed estimates available for investment in private equipment beyond what is presented in the underlying detail Table 5.5.5U?” (see the section on “PEQ Bridge”). 20 Value put in place is measured as the sum of the cost of materials installed or erected; cost of labor supplied by contractors and by project owners; and a proportionate share of the cost of construction equipment rental, contractors’ profit, cost of architectural and engineering work, miscellaneous overhead and office costs chargeable to the project on the owners’ books, and interest and taxes paid during construction. 21 These adjustments are for own-account construction, for small projects that are excluded from the value- put-in-place data, and for nonresidential improvements.",

In a few cases, the allocation is entirely to final use (for example, motor vehicles) or to intermediate use (for example, semiconductors).22 The commodity-flow calculations also include estimates of trade margins and transportation costs23 and estimates of transactions in used equipment (see the technical note at the end of this chapter). The following estimates are prepared directly rather than by commodity flow: installation costs for communication equipment, industrial process design costs, and expenditures for nuclear fuel rods, and for scrap metal. For intellectual property products, the benchmark-year estimates for purchased software are based on industry receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census. The estimates for own-account software are measured as the sum of production costs, including the value of capital services (which includes depreciation). The estimates are based on BLS data on occupational employment and wages, on Economic Census data, and on BEA-derived measures of capital services.24 The benchmark-year estimates for R&D are based on NSF survey data, and the estimates for entertainment originals are based on revenue data from the Economic Census. (For more information on the estimates for intellectual property products, see the technical note at the end of this chapter.) Nonbenchmark-year estimates The estimates of structures for nonbenchmark years are generally prepared at the same level of detail as those for benchmark years. For most components, the estimates are prepared by using the monthly construction spending data as an indicator series to extrapolate the benchmark-year estimates (see “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in Chapter 4) and by assuming that the relationships underlying the benchmark estimates remain unchanged. For example, the coverage adjustments made to the construction spending data for the benchmark year are assumed to be a constant proportion for periods after the benchmark year until the next benchmark estimates are available. The estimates of equipment for nonbenchmark years are generally prepared at a more aggregate level of detail than those for benchmark years, primarily because data on shipments are not available for the detailed product groupings. For most components, the estimates are prepared using an abbreviated form of the commodity-flow method that accommodates the available source data. For years except the most recent year, the primary source for domestic manufacturers’ shipments is the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), which collects data by product class; for the most recent 22 For a description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates for new motor vehicles, see the technical note in “Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures.” 23 Trade margins measure the cost of marketing goods from producers to final purchasers, including markups by wholesalers and retailers. Transportation costs measure the costs of carrying goods by rail, truck, water, air, and liquid and gas pipelines. 24 For more information, see Jason W. Chute, Stephanie H. McCulla, and Shelly Smith, “Preview of the 2018 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 98 (April 2018): 13.",

For most components, estimates of exports and imports (based on international trade data), government purchases (based on Federal agency administrative data and on Census Bureau surveys of state and local government finance), and inventories (based on Census Bureau surveys and on IRS tabulations of business tax returns) are available. The estimates of the distributions of purchases among consumers, business final use, and business intermediate purchases are largely based on the benchmark relationships. For intellectual property products, the nonbenchmark-year estimates for purchased software are based on receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey (SAS), and the estimates of own-account software are primarily based on BLS data on employment and wages. The nonbenchmark-year estimates for R&D are based on NSF survey data and SAS receipts data, and the estimates for entertainment originals are primarily based on SAS revenue data. (For more information on the estimates for intellectual property products, see the technical note at the end of this chapter.) Current quarterly estimates The seasonally adjusted current-dollar quarterly estimates—that is, the estimates for the quarters that have not yet been subject to an annual update—for most categories of structures are prepared by extrapolation, using the same data sources as those used for the nonbenchmark-year estimates. For net purchases of used structures, the current quarterly estimates are based on judgmental trends. For petroleum and natural gas exploration and drilling, the quantity estimates for the current quarter are prepared first by extrapolating the quantity annual series using indicator series; these estimates are then converted (reflated) to current-dollar values using quarterly price indexes. The current quarterly estimates for equipment are prepared by the abbreviated commodity-flow method at the same aggregated level and based on the same data source as that used for the most-recent-year estimates (figure 6.1). For intellectual property products, the current quarterly estimates for purchased software are based on receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Services (QSS) when available; when they are not available, the estimates are judgmentally trended by BEA. Estimates of own-account software are based on BLS current employment statistics. The current quarterly estimates for R&D are based on company reports and receipts data from the QSS when available; when unavailable, estimates are judgmentally trended by BEA. The estimates for entertainment originals are based on QSS revenue data when available and are otherwise judgmentally trended by BEA.25 (For more information on the estimates for intellectual property products, see the technical note at the end of this chapter.) 25 Because of data limitations, BEA does not publish current quarterly estimates for individual research and development and entertainment-original components.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-12 The not seasonally adjusted estimates are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted estimates, using the not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators. The abbreviated procedure for preparing the current quarterly estimate for a typical equipment component may be summarized as follows: 1. Manufacturers’ industry shipments are taken from the monthly Survey of Manufacturers’ Shipments, Inventories, and Orders. 2. The shipments by industry are converted to private equipment shipments by product, using information on the relationship between industry shipments and product shipments from the most recent year’s ASM. 3. Exports are subtracted from, and imports are added to, the product shipments, yielding an estimate of domestic supply. The data on exports and imports are from the Census Bureau. 4. No attempt is made to estimate the effects of quarterly inventory changes on the commodity flow for any commodities. 5. Business intermediate purchases are subtracted from domestic supply, primarily based on ratios derived from the detailed benchmark I-O estimates, and consumer purchases and government purchases are subtracted, primarily based on information from the most recent annual estimates.

    "text": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-13 6. Trade and transportation margins, based on detailed benchmark I-O estimates, are added in order to convert domestic supply in producers’ prices to PFI in purchasers’ prices. 7. The resulting estimate is used to extrapolate the most recent annual estimate. Quantity and price estimates The estimates of quantities purchased, or real spending, for most of the detailed PFI categories are prepared by deflation. Under this method, the quantities are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by an “appropriate” price index (with the reference year set equal to 100). For petroleum and natural gas exploration and drilling, the quantity estimates are prepared by direct valuation (see the technical note). (For a general description of these methods, see “Estimates for detailed components” in Chapter 4.) For structures, a wide variety of price indexes from public and private sources are used as deflators. For some components of nonresidential structures, quality-adjusted output price measures, such as PPIs, are not available, and BEA uses combinations of input-cost measures and output-cost measures in an effort to capture productivity and quality changes.26 For most equipment categories, detailed PPIs and import price indexes from BLS are used. For intellectual property products, a variety of price indexes are used (for more information, see the technical note at the end of this chapter). The aggregate PFI measures are calculated from the detailed components as chain-type quantity and price indexes (for information about these calculations, see “Estimates for NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 4). BEA also prepares measures of real PFI and its components in a dollar-denominated form, designated “chained-dollar” estimates (see “Chained-dollar measures” in Chapter 4).27 26 For more information, see Paul R. Lally, “BEA Briefing: How BEA Accounts for Investment in Private Structures,” Survey 89 (February 2009): 11. 27 BEA does not provide chained-dollar measures (as distinct from chain-weighted indexes and percent changes) for computers, which are affected by highly volatile changes in prices and quantities (see J. Steven Landefeld, Brent R. Moulton, and Cindy M. Vojtech, “Chained-Dollar Indexes: Issues, Tips on Their Use, and Upcoming Changes,” Survey 83 (November 2003): 16.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-35 Technical Note: Special Estimates This section provides additional detail on the sources and methods used to estimate the following key components of private fixed investment (PFI): new single- family structures, used equipment, and intellectual property products. New single-family structures This PFI component measures the construction of fully detached units and of other units (such as rowhouses and townhouses) that are separated from adjacent units by a ground-to-roof wall and that do not share heating/air conditioning systems or other interstructural public utilities (such as water supply, power supply, or sewage disposal lines). The value of new single-family construction excludes the value of land, marketing costs, closing costs, and movable appliances. The annual and quarterly estimates of investment in new single-family structures are based on the Census Bureau’s monthly construction statistics on the value of new construction put in place for one-unit structures. The Census Bureau determines the construction cost of new single-family houses started each month using data from its monthly Survey of Construction. Construction costs are estimated separately for units built to be sold or rented and for units built by an owner or for an owner on contract. The estimated cost of all single-family units started is then distributed into monthly value put in place by applying fixed 12-month patterns of monthly construction progress.28 The patterns vary somewhat depending on the particular month the unit is started; in general, the progress pattern assumes that about 16 percent of the project is completed in the first month, about 23 percent in the second month, about 20 percent in the third month, about 15 percent in the fourth month, about 10 percent in the fifth month, and the remainder is distributed in declining amounts over the succeeding 7 months. For the advance current quarterly estimate, only 2 months of value-put-in-place data are available. BEA estimates the value put in place for the third month, primarily based on data on housing starts for that month and on the Census Bureau’s construction progress pattern. Quantity estimates. The estimates of investment in real new single-family structures are prepared by deflation, using the Census Bureau price index for new one- family houses under construction. 28 For more information, see “Construction Methodology” at www.census.gov.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 6-36 Used equipment Aside from trade margins and commissions earned by the services of brokers and dealers, transactions in secondhand fixed assets among sectors do not reflect current production activity and so do not affect gross domestic product. However, these transfers of assets between sectors are recorded in the NIPAs so that the estimates of fixed investment are consistent with the estimates of the net stock of private fixed assets. Moreover, the estimates of saving by the individual sectors of the economy must reflect purchases of used equipment as well as purchases of new equipment. Thus, net purchases of used equipment by private business from households, governments, and the rest of the world are added to investment in equipment and software and are subtracted (as net sales) from personal consumption expenditures, from government fixed investment, and from net exports, respectively. Sales of used motor vehicles by business to persons account for the bulk of these intersectoral transactions; thus in the NIPAs, total net purchases of equipment by private business is negative. (For a detailed description of the methodology used to prepare the NIPA estimates for net purchases of used motor vehicles, see the technical note in “Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures”). For benchmark years, transactions in used equipment by commodity (other than motor vehicles) are derived as the sum of the trade margins on sales of used equipment and of net sales of used equipment between business and the other sectors of the economy. The trade margins are estimated using information from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census. Net sales between business and persons are also from the Economic Census. Net sales between business and the federal government are from federal agency source data, primarily from the Government Services Administration; net sales between business and state and local governments are from the Census Bureau’s census of governments. Net exports of used equipment are based on Census Bureau foreign trade data. For nonbenchmark years other than the most recent year, net exports are based on foreign trade data, net sales between business and government are from federal agency source data and from the annual survey of government finances, and trade margins and net sales between business and other sectors are prepared by extrapolation using the change in new nonresidential equipment.

Most intellectual property products are not sold in an open market, so other valuation methods must be used in measuring the investment in these assets. Thus, investment in own-account software and in R&D is measured as the sum of production costs, and investment in entertainment originals is measured using net present valuation. Software Investment in software comprises purchases of prepackaged software and of customized software from companies that are primarily engaged in software development and of expenditures for the own-account production of new or significantly enhanced software that the business enterprise develops in-house. Purchased software For benchmark years, the current-dollar estimates for purchases of prepackaged software and for custom software are based on industry receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census and are derived using the commodity-flow method (for a general description of this method, see “Commodity-flow method” in Chapter 4). For nonbenchmark years, the estimates are based on industry receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey and are derived using an abbreviated commodity-flow method (described earlier in this chapter).

For custom software, the deflator is a weighted average of the prepackaged software price and a BEA input-cost index that is based on Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) data on wage rates for computer programmers and systems analysts and on intermediate input costs associated with the production of software.

In addition, wages are reduced by subtracting the portion of wages paid by the “computer systems design and related services industry” for the production of custom software for sale; these sales are already included in the PFI estimates of custom software. The data on employment by industry and the data on wages by occupation are from the BLS occupational employment and wage statistics survey.

The estimates of input costs are based on relationships between intermediate inputs and compensation that are derived primarily from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census.

For benchmark years and for nonbenchmark years, the estimates of private fixed investment in R&D are primarily based on R&D expenditures data from three National Science Foundation (NSF) annual surveys: the Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey, the Annual Business Survey, and the Higher Education Research and Development Survey. These surveys are based on R&D by performer, but they also collect data on the funder of the R&D, and BEA uses these data to put R&D investment on an ownership basis. (Federal purchases and grants of R&D are both treated as investment by the federal sector because the federal government receives economic benefits and because of the difficulty in distinguishing ownership between the funder and the performer of the R&D in the source data.) In addition to the NSF data, revenue data from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey (SAS) are used in the R&D calculations. BEA then further adjusts the data for coverage, for scope, and for alignment with NIPA framework and concepts. These adjustments include (1) accounting for imported and exported R&D, (2) adding social science R&D, which is captured separately on the NSF surveys, (3) converting depreciation for structures and equipment used to produce R&D to an economic cost basis, (4) reconciling the NSF data with data from the Census Bureau’s economic censes (only in benchmark years), (5) replacing NSF reported expenditures for deprecation with BEA-derived capital services measures (which include depreciation),33 and (6) in certain cases, converting measures for purchased R&D from a cost-basis to a purchase-basis. For the most recent year, the estimates for business R&D investment are extrapolated based on R&D expenses reported by publicly traded companies on their annual financial statements, and on QSS industry receipts data on scientific research and development services. For nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISHs), the estimates for universities and colleges are based on judgmental trend, and the estimates for other NPISHs are based on federal budget data on R&D outlays to NPISHs, QSS industry receipts data, and judgmental trends. For the current quarterly estimates, the “third” and “second” estimates for total business R&D are extrapolated based on R&D expenses from the quarterly financial reports of publicly traded companies, and on revenue data from the QSS. The “advance” estimate is based on judgmental trends.

For own-account R&D and for purchases from other businesses, nonacademic NPISHs, and state and local governments, the deflator is a Fisher-weighted price index of productivity-adjusted, input-cost based indexes for two specific industries: scientific research and development services, and all other private industries. The input-cost indexes are composed of wages, materials and supplies, economic depreciation, and other costs, and the weights for these cost components are derived from the NSF Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey. For purchases from academic institutions, the deflator is a productivity-adjusted, input-cost based index composed of university faculty and research associates’ compensation, overhead, purchased services, materials and supplies, and economic depreciation, and the weights for these cost components are derived from the NSF Higher Education Research and Development Survey. Entertainment, literary, and artistic originals Entertainment, literary, and artistic originals consists of theatrical movies, long- lived television programs, books, music, and other miscellaneous entertainment (such as theatrical play scripts, greeting card designs, and commercial stock photography).35 The production of entertainment originals may span several years. Theoretically, these costs should be recorded as investment when accrued; however, due to practical constraints, BEA records the value of the investment in the year the asset is released to the public. Because adequate information on production costs is not available for most entertainment originals, BEA estimates the value of these assets based on the net present value (NPV) of expected future royalties or other revenue obtained from these assets, net of any associated sales costs.36 For each type of entertainment originals asset, the expected net cash flow of the producing industry is estimated using revenue and cost data from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census and surveys, numerous trade sources, and other sources. BEA assumes a 7-percent real discount rate for all asset types and applies an NPV adjustment factor, a ratio that represents the average NPV-to-current-year revenues in order to derive an estimate of investment in entertainment originals for that year. For benchmark years, the estimates for entertainment originals are based on product-level revenue detail from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census that is adjusted to remove nonartwork costs (which are recorded as current production costs). These data are then adjusted by applying BEA-generated investment ratios (net-present value factors) to derive the investment values.37 35 The treatment of expenditures by business and nonprofit institutions serving households on entertainment originals as fixed investment was introduced in the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs: see “Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” 18–20. 36 The SNA discusses the use of NPV for estimating the value of assets; see SNA 2008, 22, paragraph 2.60, 52, paragraph 3.137-138); see also the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Handbook on Deriving Capital Measures of Intellectual Property Products, 18, 158-159. 37 Based on research using trade sources, studies, and survey and Economic Census data, BEA estimates the following investment ratios for the five categories of entertainment originals assets: 51 percent of industry revenue for theatrical movies, 50 percent of industry revenue for music, 37 percent of industry",

Second, the value of sales costs—such as advertising, manufacturing of reproductions, and other marketing type costs—is subtracted from the total current period revenues to derive net revenue values that capture only the revenues earned on the intangible assets held by the business. Third, these net revenue values are adjusted further to only include the revenue from the release of new works (that is, the “originals”), using the BEA-derived investment ratios.38 Finally, the NPV adjustment factor is applied to the net revenue value that has been adjusted by the investment ratio in order to derive the current-period investment value of the future revenue stream of these new works. For nonbenchmark years, the estimates for entertainment originals are derived by extrapolation, primarily based on revenue data for selected product lines from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey. For the most recent year, the estimates for entertainment originals are derived by extrapolation, primarily based on revenue data from the QSS. For current quarterly estimates of total business entertainment originals, the “third” quarter estimates are based on revenue data from the QSS. The “second” and “advance” estimates for long-lived television programs, books, and other entertainment originals are based on judgmental trends.39 Quantity estimates. The estimates of real expenditures on entertainment originals are prepared using a variety of deflators. For theatrical movies, the deflator is a weighted average of the CPI for admission to movies, theaters, and concerts, the CPI for photographic equipment and supplies, and the PPI for electronic computer manufacturing. For long-lived television programs, the deflators are composed of the CPI for admission to movies, theaters, and concerts, the CPI for photographic equipment and supplies, and the PPI for electronic computer manufacturing with differing weights for fiction and nonfiction programming. For books, the deflator is the PPI for publishing sales, excluding software—sales of books. For music, the deflator for recorded music is the CPI for recorded music and music subscriptions, and the deflator for nonrecorded music is the CPI for admission to movies, theaters, and concerts. For other entertainment revenue for books, 30 percent of industry revenue for television, and 15 percent of industry revenue for miscellaneous artwork. 38 Based on research using trade sources, studies, and survey and Economic Census data from the Census Bureau, BEA estimates the following investment ratios for the five categories of entertainment originals assets: 51 percent of industry revenue for theatrical movies, 30 percent of industry revenue for television, 37 percent of industry revenue for books, 50 percent of industry revenue for music, and 15 percent of industry revenue for miscellaneous artwork.

Inventory investment is one of the most volatile components of gross domestic product (GDP), giving it an important role in short run variations in GDP growth. Moreover, inventory movement plays a key role in the timing, duration, and magnitude of business cycles, as unanticipated buildups in inventories may signal future cutbacks in production, and unanticipated shortages in inventories may signal future pickups in production. The CIPI estimates are the building blocks for BEA’s estimates of inventory stocks. These stock estimates, coupled with BEA’s estimates of final sales, form inventory-sales ratios that can be used to assess the likelihood that businesses will add to, or reduce, inventories in response to changes in demand. The CIPI estimates are an integral part of the U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts”).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-2 Definitions and Concepts CIPI is the NIPA measure of the flow (or change) in the stock of inventories held by private business over a specified period.1 The stock of inventories is the value of the goods owned by private business at the end of a specified period, whether the goods were produced or acquired in that period or in previous periods. Inventories are maintained by business in order to facilitate the production and distribution of goods or services. The items held in inventory may be in the form of goods ready for sale (finished goods), of goods undergoing production (work in process), or of goods acquired for use in the production process (materials and supplies) (table 7.1). For example, an auto dealer keeps a variety of makes, models, and parts on hand to meet the varied requirements and preferences of potential customers; an auto manufacturer keeps supplies of inputs, such as steel, on hand for use in manufacturing new vehicles. Table 7.1—Content of Change in Private Inventories Category of inventory Comments Finished/ready-for-sale goods inventory The value of produced goods held for future sale. Applies to most industries. Work-in-process inventory The value of goods still in the process of production. Applies to manufacturing and publishing industries. Materials and supplies inventory The value of natural resources and basic manufactured goods that are acquired by business for use as inputs to the production process. Applies to manufacturing, mining, construction, utilities, and publishing industries. A general principle underlying NIPA accounting is that production should be recorded at the time it occurs. In the measurement of GDP, the other product-side components, such as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and fixed investment, record final sales in the current period, but these sales may involve goods that were produced—or at least partially produced—in earlier periods. The recording of movements of goods in inventory—materials and supplies, work-in-process, and finished goods—and from inventories to final sales provides the means to allocate production to the period in which it occurred (see the box on the next page for a simple example of the allocation). 1 In the NIPAs, private business consists of all private entities that produce goods and services for sale at a price intended to at least approximate production costs and of certain other private entities that are treated as business in the NIPAs. These other entities include mutual financial institutions, private noninsured pension funds, cooperatives, and nonprofit organizations that primarily serve business (that is, entities classified as nonprofit by the Internal Revenue Service in determining income tax liability), Federal Reserve banks, and federally sponsored credit agencies.",

The value of the materials and supplies used ($10,000) is subtracted from those inventories, and the value of the produced automobile ($20,000) is added to the finished goods inventory. Thus, total change in inventories is +$10,000, and this amount— which represents production, or value added, in this period—is added to GDP. • In period II, the manufacturer ships the finished auto to an auto dealer. The value of the manufacturer’s finished goods inventory decreases by $20,000, and the value of the dealer’s inventory of autos ready for sale increases by $20,000. GDP is not affected. • In period III, the dealer sells the auto to a consumer for $22,000. The dealer’s inventory declines by $20,000. GDP increases by $2,000 (PCE of $22,000 plus CIPI of –$20,000), which represents the value added by the dealer in the form of retail margin. As a result of this accounting for inventories, the process of assembling the materials and supplies into a finished automobile is recorded in period I, when it actually occurred, rather than in period III, when the final sale occurred. Similarly, the value added by steel manufacturers and other producers of the materials and supplies that were used as inputs in period I would have been recorded in earlier periods when those goods were produced. In measuring the level of GDP, the change in, not the level of, inventories provides the appropriate measure of the flow of economic activity that is consistent with that measured by the other GDP components. A positive CIPI indicates that total production (GDP) exceeded the sum of the final sales components of GDP in the current period and that the excess production was added to inventories. A negative CIPI indicates that final sales exceeded production in the current period and that the excess sales were filled by drawing down inventories. CIPI is valued in the average prices for the period because units move in and out of inventories continuously over the course of the period.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-4 In measuring the change in GDP, the change in CIPI (or the change in inventory investment) is the relevant measure. For example, inventories may contribute to an increase in GDP (1) by accumulating in the current period after decumulating in the preceding period, (2) by accumulating more in the current period than in the preceding period, or (3) by decumulating less in the current period than in the preceding period (table 7.2). Table 7.2—Effects of Change in CIPI on Change in GDP [Billions of dollars] Most of the CIPI estimates are derived from information recorded in business- accounting statements. For an illustration of the relationships between business- accounting practices and the principles of national accounting and their varying impacts on the measurement of inventories, cost of goods sold, and profits, see appendix A to this chapter. In business accounting, the change in the book value of inventories is the measure of the difference between inventory acquisitions and inventory withdrawals during the accounting period. Generally, when a good is placed in inventory, it is valued on a firm’s books at the price prevailing when the good enters into inventory; this is sometimes referred to as “acquisition” or “historical” cost. However, there are a number of different accounting methods—such as “last in, first out” (LIFO) and “first in, first out” (FIFO)— that can be used in determining the value of the goods that are withdrawn from inventories and of the goods that remain in inventories over time.2 Another general principle underlying NIPA accounting is that (a) production should be valued at the price prevailing when it occurs, regardless of whether the good is sold immediately or it is entered into inventory for sale at a later time, and (b) a good that is withdrawn from inventory must be valued at the price prevailing when it is withdrawn, so holding gains or losses do not affect the measure of production in the current period. In business accounting, a good leaving inventory is frequently valued at historical cost— that is, at the price that prevailed when it entered inventory (see appendix A). The 2 LIFO is a method of accounting valuation of inventories that assumes the goods acquired most recently are used up first, so that withdrawals from inventory are primarily valued at recent acquisition costs. FIFO is a method that assumes the oldest stock in inventories is used up first, so withdrawals from inventory are primarily valued at earlier acquisition costs. Other valuation methods include “average cost,” “market cost,” and “standard cost.” Inventory level [stock] CIPI [flow] Contribution of change in CIPI to change in GDP I II III II III III (1) 500 495 500 -5 5 10 (2) 500 510 530 10 20 10 (3) 500 485 480 -15 -5 10",

Recording in the NIPAs As described above, CIPI provides a bridge between final sales in the current period and production in the current period. It is one of the few NIPA components that can be negative. In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, CIPI appears in the Domestic Income and Product Account (account 1) as a component of gross private domestic investment and in the Domestic Capital Account (account 6) as a component of gross domestic investment. In the NIPAs, the inventory estimates are generally shown by industry classification, using the North American Industry Classification System, rather than by type of product classification (see Chapter 2). Thus, for example, “wholesale trade durable goods inventories” signifies “inventories held by industries engaged in the wholesale trade of durable goods.” CIPI by industry is presented in NIPA table group 5.7. Stocks of private inventories, along with the corresponding aggregate estimates of final sales and inventory-sales ratios, are shown in table group 5.8. The following is a list of the principal NIPA tables that present the inventory estimates: 5.7.5B Change in Private Inventories by Industry 5.7.6B Change in Real Private Inventories by Industry, Chained Dollars 5.8.5B Private Inventories and Domestic Final Sales by Industry 5.8.6B Real Private Inventories and Real Domestic Final Sales by Industry, Chained Dollars 5.8.9B Implicit Price Deflators for Private Inventories by Industry In addition, estimates of change in motor vehicle inventories are shown in tables 7.2.5B and 7.2.6B, and estimates of change in farm inventories are shown in tables 7.3.5 and 7.3.6. BEA also prepares estimates of the change in private inventories that are not seasonally adjusted; these are available in Section 8 of the NIPA Interactive Data Tables. The tables present nominal, or “current-dollar” measures and “real,” or inflation-adjusted measures. Additionally, BEA prepares “Underlying Detail” tables for the estimates shown in NIPA table group 5.7, including detail for change in the book values and for IVA by industry, at a greater level of detail than is shown in the published estimates.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-6 BEA publishes estimates of real inventories, sales, and inventory-sales ratios for the manufacturing and trade industries each quarter in the Survey of Current Business (generally in the January, April, July, and October issues). BEA also prepares “Underlying Detail” tables for these estimates. Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier in this handbook, the NIPA estimates, including those for CIPI, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see Chapter 4: Estimating Methods). For farm inventories, the estimates of crop and of livestock inventory change are prepared as the product of the change in the physical volume and of the average price, based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, changes in stocks of wheat on the farm are calculated as wheat harvested and available for sale less wheat sold, valued at average market prices. The estimates of farm inventories include materials and supplies—such as feed, fertilizer, and purchased seed—that are used as inputs to farm production. For crops, the estimates also take into account Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans to producers who use agricultural commodities as collateral.3 Because the estimates of farm inventories are prepared using data on quantities and current prices rather than business-accounting data, an IVA is not calculated. For nonfarm industries, the estimates of inventory change are generally prepared by beginning with data on the end-of-period book value of inventories, as reported by private business using a variety of accounting methods.4 The inventory data are then adjusted—annually for 167 industries and monthly for 133 industries—to value the inventories at a uniform set of prices and to remove holding gains or losses. More specifically, for manufacturing and trade industries, data on the book value of inventory stocks, inventory turnover, and on the methods of inventory valuation are collected in economic censuses and annual surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. Businesses that use LIFO accounting also provide the Census Bureau with an estimate of the “LIFO reserve,” an adjustment for converting their inventories to a non-LIFO valuation. Data on inventory stocks at the end of the month (and quarter) are collected in 3 Placement of crops as collateral for CCC loans is treated as an addition to farm inventories. Redemption of the crop after loan repayment or forfeiture of the crop after loan default are each treated as a withdrawal from farm inventories. The data on the physical quantities of crops placed, redeemed, and forfeited are from USDA and are valued using average market prices. 4 As a practical matter, the source data for end-of period inventories reflect losses that result from damage, theft, and other causes, as well as business write-downs. When these episodic events can be identified, BEA adjusts the source data to remove these affects.",

In the Census Bureau’s published reports of manufacturing and trade inventories, all inventories are valued on a “non-LIFO basis.”5 For most other nonfarm industries, annual data on the book value of inventory stocks are available from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tabulations of business tax returns. The data include information on inventory stocks, the proportions of those stocks that are valued on a LIFO basis, and inventory turnover. For most nonfarm industries, the principal price data used in estimating NIPA inventories are producer price indexes (PPIs) and import price indexes, both from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). For the manufacturing and publishing industries, the prices for work-in-process and finished goods inventories consist of a combination of the following: the cost of materials and supplies, based on PPIs; labor costs, based on BEA- constructed unit labor cost indexes; and overhead costs—including rent, depreciation charges, and repair costs—primarily based on PPIs. The BEA labor cost indexes cover compensation of production workers, supervisors, and nonproduction personnel working at the plant and are based on BEA wage data. At the most detailed level for which BEA prepares estimates, the procedure for nonfarm inventories generally consists of the following steps that yield current-dollar and constant-dollar estimates for CIPI and for the stocks of goods held in inventory. For an illustration of the estimation procedure, see appendix B to this chapter. 1. Separating Census Bureau published inventories (which are on a non- LIFO basis) into those that were reported on a LIFO basis and those that were reported using other accounting methods. 2. Construction of current-period inventory price indexes for each industry, and for manufacturing and for publishing, each stage of fabrication. 3. Construction of monthly cost indexes for each industry, and for manufacturing and publishing, each stage of fabrication. 4. Revaluation of the book-value inventories to yield constant-dollar and current-dollar change in inventories. 5. Calculation of the IVA. 6. Calculation of current-dollar and constant-dollar stocks. As noted earlier, the IVA is the measure of the holding gains or losses that are removed from the business-accounting measure of inventory change. It is calculated for all inventory-accounting methods, regardless of whether inventories are accumulating or decumulating over the recording period. However, under LIFO accounting, if inventories are accumulating, withdrawals are already valued at current-period prices; thus, CIPI and change in the book value are equal, and the IVA is zero (see appendix A). 5 The Census Bureau reports inventories on a non-LIFO basis because during periods of rising inventories and prices, LIFO accounting may result in stock estimates that are considerably undervalued (see appendix A).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-8 In the NIPAs, the IVA is also used on the income side of the accounts in order to exclude the inventory holding gains (or losses) from business income in the calculation of corporate profits and of nonfarm proprietors’ income.6 Since profit and income data come from IRS tabulations, the product-side IVA must be adjusted for any accounting- basis differences between the IRS data and the Census Bureau data. (The estimates for nonfarm industries other than manufacturing and trade are already based on IRS data, so in most cases no adjustment is needed for those industries.) In estimating the stocks of private inventories, the constant-dollar estimates are derived first, using the perpetual inventory method—that is, by adding the change in real private inventories during the period to the real stocks at the end of the preceding period (see “perpetual inventory method” in Chapter 4). The end-of-period current-dollar estimates of the stock of private inventories are then derived by “reflation”—that is, by multiplying estimates of the end-of-period real-stocks by appropriate price indexes. Table 7.A at the end of this chapter summarizes the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the benchmark-year, nonbenchmark-year, current quarterly, and quantity (inflation-adjusted) estimates for the CIPI categories that are shown by industry in NIPA table group 5.7. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Benchmark-year estimates For manufacturing, data on the book value of inventory stocks and on the methods of inventory valuation are available from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census. Manufacturing establishments report their end-of-year inventory levels and their inventories by stage of fabrication (finished, work-in-process, and materials and supplies). Information on the distribution of costs in the manufacturing sector among materials, labor, and overhead is used in the calculation of cost of goods sold and of inventory turnover ratios (see appendix B). The commodity composition of materials held in inventory is assumed to be the same as that for materials purchased by the industry, which, in turn, is derived from BEA’s benchmark input-output accounts, based on information from the economic censuses on materials “consumed” by industry. This information is used in the calculation of materials held in inventory. For wholesale and retail trade, data on the book value of inventory stocks and the methods of inventory valuation are available from the Economic Census. Retail and wholesale trade establishments report their inventories of goods for sale at the end of the 6 See NIPA table 6.14D, “Inventory Valuation Adjustment to Nonfarm Incomes by Legal Form of Organization and by Industry,” available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov.",

For wholesale and retail trade, data on purchases from the Economic Census are used in the calculation of cost of goods sold and of inventory-turnover ratios. In addition, data on product-line sales by industry are used in the calculation of commodities held in inventory. For the mining and construction industries, the inventory estimates for benchmark years are based on information from the Economic Census. For the publishing industry, the inventory estimates are based on information from the Service Annual Survey. For all other nonfarm industries, the estimates for all years except the most recent year are based on IRS tabulations of income tax returns for corporations and for sole proprietorships and partnerships. For farm inventories, the estimates for all years (benchmark and nonbenchmark) are based on USDA annual reports. Annual changes in farm inventories of crops are estimated as crops harvested in the period and available for sale (that is, not including crops retained for personal consumption) less crops sold in the period plus net CCC loan transactions. The annual quantity changes for each crop are valued at average market prices received by farmers during the calendar year. Annual changes in farm inventories of livestock are estimated from USDA surveys of inventory stocks on farms. For each livestock commodity, annual quantity changes are valued at average market price per head. Nonbenchmark-year estimates For years other than benchmark years and the most recent year, the inventory estimates for the manufacturing, trade, and publishing industries are primarily based on the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures, Annual Wholesale Trade Survey, Annual Retail Trade Survey, and Service Annual Survey. Respondents to these surveys report LIFO, LIFO reserve, and non-LIFO valuations separately. In addition, respondents in the manufacturing sector report information on the distribution of costs among materials, labor, and overhead and those in retail and wholesale report purchases; this information is used in the calculation of cost of goods sold and of inventory-turnover ratios. For the mining, utilities, and construction industries, as well as for other nonfarm industries, the estimates for all nonbenchmark years except the most recent year are based on IRS tabulations of income tax returns for corporations and for sole proprietorships and partnerships. 7 The wholesale trade inventory data published by the Census Bureau include inventories that are owned by U.S. establishments but are held abroad. BEA adjusts these wholesale trade data in order to exclude those inventories. The retail trade inventory data published by the Census Bureau exclude inventories that are owned by U.S. establishments but are held abroad.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-10 The sources and methods for deriving the nonbenchmark-year estimates of farm inventories are the same as those for the benchmark estimates (see above). Most-recent-year and current-quarterly estimates The seasonally adjusted inventory estimates for the most recent year and for the current quarters for the manufacturing and trade industries (except those for retail auto dealers) are based on the following Census Bureau surveys: Monthly Survey of Manufacturers’ Shipments, Inventories, and Orders; Monthly Wholesale Trade Survey; Monthly Retail Trade Survey; and the Census Bureau’s monthly Advance Economic Indicators Report.8 The data for manufacturing, wholesale trade, and retail trade are summarized in the Census Bureau’s monthly “Business Sales and Inventories” release. The quarterly estimates for the manufacturing and trade industries are calculated as end- of-month inventories for the final month of the quarter less end-of-month inventories for the final month of the preceding quarter. For retail auto dealers, seasonally adjusted inventory estimates for the most recent year and for the current quarters are primarily based on a weighted average of BEA’s unit-based estimates, which are based on the monthly unit data from Wards’ Intelligence, and of Census Bureau total motor vehicle inventories. For utilities, the seasonally adjusted quantity estimates are prepared first, using data on changes in the physical stocks of coal, petroleum, and natural gas and on base- year prices from the Energy Information Administration. The current-dollar estimates are then derived by “reflation”—that is, by multiplying the quantity estimates by appropriate price data from BLS. For all other nonfarm industries, seasonally adjusted estimates for the most recent year and for the current quarters are prepared by starting with the previous annual level and by assuming that inventories move proportionately with certain other indicator series chosen for each industry or by judgmental trend. The indicator series include inventory information from the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Financial Report and monthly measures of activity from the Census Bureau’s construction statistics and from BLS industry wage data. For seasonally adjusted farm inventories, quarterly estimates of crop inventories, which are calculated only for total crops, are based on a BEA quarterly allocation of USDA annual projections of crop output and cash receipts. Quarterly estimates of livestock inventories are based on USDA data by type of livestock. 8 The Census Bureau’s Advance Economic Indicators Report provides advance statistics for U.S. International Trade in Goods, domestic retail inventories, and domestic wholesale inventories. Advance measures of domestic retail and wholesale inventories were first provided in July 2016; the Census Bureau provides the report to BEA in time for it to be incorporated into its advance estimates of GDP.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 7-11 The not seasonally adjusted (NSA) estimates of inventories are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates, using the not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators. Quantity and price estimates The quantity estimates for the detailed inventory components are primarily derived by deflation, as shown in appendix B. (For a general description of the deflation method, see “Estimates for detailed components” in Chapter 4.) In the NIPAs, the aggregate measures for most of the components of real GDP are calculated from the detailed components as chain-type quantity and price indexes (see “Estimates for NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 4). However, the detailed CIPI estimates may contain negative values (which could require the Fisher formula to take the square root of a negative number).9 Therefore, the end-of period, chain-weighted estimates of inventory stocks are calculated first, and the CIPI chained-dollar estimates are then calculated as the differences between these estimates. Under this procedure, inventory stocks are used as weights for inventory flows, though the composition of the stocks may differ from the composition of the inventory investment flows. 9 The inability to calculate Fisher quantity indexes for CIPI does not extend to higher level aggregates (such as gross private domestic investment and GDP) that include CIPI as a component, because the negative values of CIPI are small relative to the levels of the other components of those aggregates.",

The illustration is based on one retail establishment that holds only one type of good in inventory. The unit cost and the sales price increase over time, but they are equal to each other in each period, so any profit (or loss) made by the establishment is solely the result of changes in the prices of goods held in inventory. Exhibit 1 provides information on goods purchased by the establishment in periods 0 to 3; these goods then were sold in that same period or were added to inventory. It also provides information on goods sold by the establishment in periods 1 to 3; these goods were purchased in that same period or were withdrawn from the inventory of goods that were purchased in earlier periods. Exhibit 1—Purchases and Sales Purchases Sales Period Quantity Unit cost Book value Quantity Price Revenue 0 100 $1 $100 ….. ….. ….. 1 10 $2 $20 10 $2 $20 2 10 $3 $30 5 $3 $15 3 10 $4 $40 20 $4 $80 Exhibit 2 presents the LIFO-accounting treatment for the cost of goods sold (COGS), the book value of inventories, and the resulting measure of profit for the establishment. Exhibit 2—Inventory Accounting on a LIFO Basis Period Book value at beginning of period Purchases Cost of goods sold (COGS) Quantity in inventory Book value at end of period Change in book value Recorded profit (revenue minus COGS) 0 $0 $100 $0 100 $100 ….. ….. 1 $100 $20 $20 100 $100 0 $0 2 $100 $30 $15 105 $115 $15 $0 3 $115 $40 $60 95 $95 –$20 $20",

The turnover period (the average time a good is held in inventory), which is used in deriving the monthly cost index, is 4 months. The turnover pattern (the pattern of how goods are withdrawn from inventory), is also used in deriving the monthly cost index. The pattern, starting with the most recent month, is 0.23, 0.62, 0.14, and 0.01. • The inventory composition for this industry is 40 percent of commodity A and 60 percent of commodity B. The monthly producer price indexes (PPIs) for each of these commodities are shown in the first two columns of exhibit 2. Step 1: Separating Census Bureau published inventories into those that were reported on a LIFO basis and those that were reported using other accounting methods Exhibit 1 Time period Census Bureau non- LIFO inventories LIFO reserve Book value of inventories LIFO inventories FIFO inventories May 110 10 100 10 90 June 130 10 120 12 108 Book value of inventories.

In calculating the average price at the detailed industry level, BEA applies a fixed-weight aggregation structure, based on weights from the economic censuses, when combining specific commodities held within an industry rather than a Fisher aggregation. 11 This illustrated calculation is that used under FIFO accounting.

Constant-dollar change is calculated as the difference between the FIFO book values for each month deflated by the monthly cost index: for June, ($108 / 1.16880) – ($90 / 1.14623) = $13.88. Current-dollar change is then calculated by reflating the constant-dollar change using the average monthly price index: for June, $13.88 x 1.1935 = $16.57. Change in LIFO inventories. Because LIFO inventories increased from May to June, current-dollar change is equal to change in LIFO book value: for June, $2.00 (see appendix A). Constant-dollar change is calculated by deflating the change in LIFO book value by the average monthly price index: for June, ($2.00 / 1.1935) = $1.68. Current-dollar change in inventories. Calculated as the sum of the current-dollar change in FIFO inventories and the current-dollar change in LIFO inventories: for June, $16.57 + $2.00 = $18.57. Constant-dollar change in inventories.

Step 5: Calculation of the Inventory Valuation Adjustment (IVA) Change in the book value of inventories. Calculated as the difference in the Census Bureau non-LIFO inventory levels: for June, $130 – $110 = $20. IVA. Calculated as the difference between current-dollar change in inventories and change in the book value of inventories: for June, $18.57 – $20.00 = –$1.43. (Note that because LIFO inventories increased during this period, the IVA for the LIFO portion of inventory change is $0, and the IVA for the FIFO portion is $16.57 – $18.00 = – $1.43.)

Exports measures the portion of total U.S. production of goods and services—gross domestic product (GDP)—that is provided to the rest of the world; thus, movements in exports reflect changes in foreign demand for U.S.-produced goods and services. Imports measures the portion of total U.S. expenditures—gross domestic purchases—that is accounted for by goods and services provided by the rest of the world; thus, movements in imports reflect changes in domestic demand for foreign-produced goods and services. The impact of imports on the U.S. economy depends on the degree to which they act as substitutes for, or as complements to, domestic production. Together, the two measures reflect the extent to which the United States participates in the global marketplace, which provides broad opportunities for specialization and other economic efficiencies. As the difference between the two, net exports represents the gap between U.S. domestic production and U.S. domestic demand and the extent to which a surplus or deficit of domestic production relative to domestic demand is addressed by foreign markets. Net exports in the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) corresponds to the measure “balance on goods and services”—commonly referred to as the “trade deficit” (when imports exceeds exports) or the “trade surplus” (when exports exceeds imports)—in the international transactions (or balance of payments) accounts (ITAs), also produced by BEA.1 The two measures are very similar, but they differ in coverage, definitions, and in timing of revisions (see the section “Adjustments and other differences between the NIPA and ITA estimates). Net exports is also a component of the “balance on current account,” a measure in both the ITAs and the NIPAs that also includes receipts and payments of income and receipts and payments of current taxes, contributions for government social insurance, and transfers. 1 For a detailed description of the ITAs, see “U.S. International Economic Accounts: Concepts and Methods” available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 8-2 Net exports also relates GDP to other important aggregates in the NIPAs. GDP less net exports is equal to gross domestic purchases, which is the market value of goods and services purchased by U.S. residents regardless of where those goods and services are produced. Final sales of domestic product (worldwide final sales of U.S. production) less net exports is equal to final sales to domestic purchasers, which is the market value of final goods and services purchased by U.S. residents regardless of where those goods and services are produced. Net exports is also used in preparing two alternative measures of U.S. production—command-basis GDP and command-basis gross national product (GNP)— that provide information on the real purchasing power of the income generated by U.S. production of goods and services.2 These measures reflect the impact of changes in the terms of trade and of changes in production on the purchasing power associated with the nation’s output. More specifically, these measures deflate exports and imports of goods and services (and, in the case of command-basis GNP, also income receipts and payments) by the price index for gross domestic purchases (which measures the prices of goods and services purchased by U.S. residents). Thus, the command-basis measures reflect the prices of purchased goods and services, while real GDP and real GNP reflect the prices of produced goods and services. Other related measures include the trading gains index, which is measured as the ratio of the GDP price index to the price index for gross domestic purchases, and the terms of trade index, which is measured as the ratio of the price index for exports of goods and services to the price index for imports of goods and services.3 Definitions and Concepts The estimates of net exports are an integral part of the NIPAs, a set of accounts that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts”). As discussed in Chapter 2, net exports is one of the final expenditures components of GDP. It is equal to exports, which measures all goods and services sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by residents of the United States to foreign residents (also referred to as nonresidents or the rest of the world) less imports, an offsetting component of GDP that measures all goods and services sold, given away, or otherwise transferred by foreign residents to U.S. residents. The inclusion of exports as a component of GDP is straightforward; as explained in Chapter 2, in the final expenditures approach, GDP is measured by summing the final expenditures of persons, businesses, governments, and foreigners for goods and services produced in the United States. Because exports to foreign residents represent the endpoint 2 GDP measures the value of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States, while GNP measures the value of goods and services produced by labor and property supplied by U.S. residents. GNP is equal to GDP less net income payments to the rest of the world. BEA also prepares alternative command-basis measures of net national product and of net domestic product. 3 For more information, see the section “Principal quantity and price measures” in Chapter 2.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 8-3 of domestic production, they include goods and services intended for intermediate as well as final use; any further processing that occurs outside of the United States is foreign production and is not included in GDP. For example, automotive parts that are produced in the United States and shipped to a final assembly plant in Canada are included in U.S. exports and counted as final expenditures in GDP. The inclusion of imports as an offsetting entry in deriving GDP and the inclusion of intermediate goods and services in imports warrant further explanation. Imports represent production that has occurred outside the United States, and thus they are not included in GDP. However, purchases of imported goods and services, as well as purchases of domestic goods and services, are included in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), gross private domestic investment, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment so that these final expenditure components of GDP will accurately reflect the aggregate demand of persons, businesses, and governments for goods and services wherever they are produced.4 Thus, imports is included in the calculation of GDP as a counter-entry that offsets the non-U.S. production that is included in these final expenditures components. For example, a U.S. consumer may purchase an automobile (a final good) that is produced in the United States or in a foreign country. In either case, the purchase is recorded in PCE (a positive entry in deriving GDP); however, in the case of a foreign automobile, the purchase is offset in U.S. imports (a negative entry in deriving GDP).5 Similarly, a domestic automobile manufacturer may purchase steel (an intermediate good) from either a domestic or a foreign manufacturer; the steel is either used in the production process and included in the value of the final product (and therefore GDP) during that period, or it is added to the manufacturer’s inventory of materials and supplies (also a positive entry in deriving GDP). 6 The domestically produced steel reflects value added that contributes to GDP; in contrast, the foreign-produced steel reflects value added that does not reflect U.S. production and that is offset by the recording of imports of steel (a negative entry in deriving GDP). Residents of the United States—as defined in both the NIPAs and the ITAs—are (1) individuals residing permanently in the United States, (2) business enterprises and nonprofit organizations established under U.S. laws, including corporations, partnerships, and proprietorships, and (3) U.S. federal, state, and local governments, together with their 4 Additionally, the source data for estimating these final expenditures components do not, for the most part, distinguish between domestically produced and foreign-produced goods and services. 5 Another example is the payments by U.S. residents to foreign residents for travel services. These expenditures are included in PCE collectively as “Foreign travel by U.S. residents” in the category “Net foreign travel”; unlike other expenditures on imports, they are not distributed among the individual PCE categories. They are also recorded as imports of goods and services; thus, the PCE and import entries cancel out in deriving GDP. For the results of research aimed at better separating spending by nonresidents from spending by U.S. residents in the detailed PCE statistics, see Michael Armah and Teresita Teensma, “Research Spotlight: Estimates of Categories of Personal Consumption Expenditures Adjusted for Net Foreign Travel Spending,” Survey of Current Business 92 (April 2012): 13–21. 6 The NIPA accounting for change in private inventories ensures that the value added at each stage of domestic production—including production of intermediate goods—is included in GDP in the period in which it occurs without being double-counted as further processing occurs (see the box “Simple Example of CIPI Role in Calculating GDP” “Chapter 7: Change in Private Inventories”).",

An exception is made for U.S. students who study abroad and foreign students who study in the United States; students retain the residency of their home country regardless of their length of stay. U.S. government employees stationed abroad (and their families) such as diplomats, consular officials, and members of the armed forces are also considered U.S. residents, regardless of their length of stay abroad. Affiliates of multinational corporations are considered residents of the country in which they are located, not residents of the country of the parent; thus, U.S. affiliates of foreign corporations are considered U.S. residents, and foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations are considered foreign residents. Economic activities of production and consumption occur predominately in the countries in which the affiliates are located. 7 Federal, state, and local governments and their agencies and subdivisions are considered residents of their home country. U.S. government installations abroad are considered residents of the United States, and foreign government installations in the United States are considered residents of their home country. International organizations such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development are considered residents of an international area beyond national boundaries, rather than residents of the country in which they are located or in which they operate. Foreign residents—as defined in both the NIPAs and the ITAs—are (1) individuals residing permanently outside of the United States, (2) business enterprises and nonprofit organizations established under the laws of foreign nations, (3) foreign governments, together with their subdivisions, and (4) international organizations located in the United States. Thus, for example, U.S. nationals who reside outside of the United States for more than 1 year (with the exception of U.S. students and U.S. government employees) and foreign affiliates of U.S. companies are considered foreign residents. In the NIPAs, the “rest of the world” sector consists of foreign residents who are transactors with U.S. residents. The definition of residency impacts the NIPAs and the ITAs differently because the geographic boundary of the United States differs between the two sets of accounts. In the NIPAs, the domestic economy of the United States encompasses the 50 states, the 7 The measure of net exports presented in the NIPAs is referred to in the ITAs as the “cross-border” measure of international transactions. The cross-border measure is an important indicator of U.S. performance in foreign markets; it reflects the net value of the transactions in goods and services between U.S. residents (including companies) and foreign residents. In addition, BEA annually provides a supplemental, “ownership-based” framework of the current- account portion of the ITAs in which net receipts resulting from sales by affiliates of U.S. and of foreign companies are combined with the “cross-border” measures of exports and imports to provide an indicator of the net effect of United States-foreign commerce on the U.S. economy. This alternative framework, which is usually published in the January issue of the Survey of Current Business, recognizes that both cross-border trade and sales through affiliates represent methods of active participation in the international markets for goods and services.",

In the NIPAs, goods are classified by type of product into broad categories that reflect the more detailed “end-use” classification system used by the ITAs. The end-use classification system for goods, which consists of 139 export categories and 142 import categories, is based on the principal use rather than the physical characteristics of the merchandise and allows changes in trade to be compared with changes in production, consumption, and income.13 Services exports and imports in the NIPAs are generally classified by type of service. However, because of data limitations, certain services are instead classified according to the type of transactors associated with them. Examples include the detailed components of travel services and services that are exported and imported by U.S. military agencies; the latter are classified as exports and imports of “government goods and services, n.e.c.” 14 Exports and imports of services in the NIPAs are each grouped into six broad categories that generally correspond to the aggregate categories used in the ITAs: transport, travel (for all purposes including education), charges for the use of intellectual property n.e.c., other business services, government goods and services n.e.c., and other exports or imports.15 Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy. In this context, net exports represents the difference between the aggregate demand by all foreign residents for goods and services produced in the United States and the aggregate demand by all U.S. residents for goods and services produced outside the United States. 12 For more information on the activities that are included in, and excluded from, production and on the exclusion of financial assets in the NIPAs, see the sections “Production boundary” and “Asset boundary” in Chapter 2. 13 The end-use categories used by BEA—such as foods, feeds, and beverages; capital goods; industrial supplies and materials; automotive products; and consumer goods—incorporate the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Brussels: Customs Cooperation Council): 1984. The system was developed under the auspices of the International Customs Cooperation Council to establish an accepted standard for the classification of internationally traded goods. 14 As part of the 2014 annual update of the NIPAs, a new category, “government goods and services n.e.c.” was introduced for both exports and imports. For exports, this component primarily consists of the previously presented category “transfers under U.S. military agency sales contracts.” For imports, the component primarily consists of the previously presented category “direct defense expenditures.” 15 The category “Other business services” consists of the following categories that are recorded separately in the ITAs: maintenance and repair services n.i.e.; insurance services; financial services; telecommunication, computer, and information services; personal, cultural, and recreational services; construction services; and “other” other business services.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 8-9 Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier in the handbook, most of the NIPA estimates are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods”). Tables 8.A (exports of goods and services) and 8.B (imports of goods and services) at the end of this chapter summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current-dollar benchmark estimates, nonbenchmark annual estimates, and current quarterly estimates, as well as the quantity and price indexes, for the categories of exports and imports shown in NIPA table group 4.2. The NIPA estimates of exports and imports are primarily based on the ITA estimates of exports and imports, though they also incorporate certain adjustments and other differences that reflect different revision schedules, geographic boundaries, and treatments for certain transactions (see the section “Adjustments and other differences between the NIPA and ITA estimates” below). In turn, the ITA estimates for goods are based primarily on Census Bureau data on trade in goods, and the ITA estimates for services are based primarily on data collected on BEA surveys and on data reported by other U.S. government agencies.17 Specifically, the ITA estimates of exports and imports of goods are based primarily on monthly compilations by the Census Bureau of data that are collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These data reflect the movement of goods between foreign countries and the United States. They exclude the following: shipments between the United States and its commonwealths and territories; shipments between the United States and its military, diplomatic, and consular installations abroad; shipments of U.S. goods returned to the United States by its Armed Forces; shipments of the personal and household effects of travelers; and shipments of goods that are in transit. The data on goods are valued at the transactions price at the port of exportation, which includes inland freight, insurance, and other charges incurred in placing the goods alongside the carrier. Loading costs and freight charges for transportation of goods beyond the port of exportation are assumed to be paid by the importing country; in the ITAs, these charges are included as exports or imports in “other” transportation services. The ITA estimates of exports and imports of services are based primarily on 10 mandatory BEA “benchmark” and quarterly surveys of international services transactions.18 These surveys provide information on the receipts and payments for a variety of services and for various types of intangible assets (such as intellectual property). The ITAs also use data from surveys conducted by other U.S. government 17 For an overview of the source data and estimating methods used in preparing the ITAs, see “U.S. International Economic Accounts: Concepts and Methods” on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 18 In this context, “benchmark” refers to the comprehensive nature of the survey and not to the NIPA comprehensive, or “benchmark,” revisions.",

These data are used in deriving estimates of travel, transport, and government goods and services n.e.c. Finally, a variety of published and unpublished source data—including information from U.S. government budgetary documents, international organizations, trade associations, and various other international transactors—are used in deriving certain ITA estimates of services. Tables 8.A (Exports of Goods and Services) and 8.B (Imports of Goods and Services) following the main text summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current-dollar benchmark, nonbenchmark, and current quarterly estimates and the quantity and price estimates for the categories shown in NIPA table group 4.2. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Benchmark-year and nonbenchmark-year estimates The benchmark and nonbenchmark annual NIPA estimates are derived using essentially the same methodologies. The differences between the benchmark and nonbenchmark annual NIPA estimates relate to the vintage of ITA data used and the number of years for which revisions are incorporated. Each annual NIPA revision incorporates on a best-level basis the revised statistics from the most recent annual revision of the ITAs (which occurs in June) as well as revised estimates for the first quarter of the current year from the ITA release for the second quarter (which occurs in September).19 The time spans of the ITA annual updates revisions are not usually limited. However, the annual updates of the NIPAs are usually limited to the previous 5 years, although the adoption of flexible annual updates in 2010 allows the expansion to additional years if warranted.20 Therefore, unless the revision period is expanded, the NIPA estimates for earlier years will differ from the ITA estimates by the amount of the revisions incorporated into the ITAs but not incorporated into the NIPAs (as well as by the other revisions incorporated into the NIPAs but not into the ITAs). As a result, the NIPA time series of foreign transactions may reflect a discontinuity between the years covered by the NIPA annual update and the preceding years. The discontinuities within the NIPA series and the statistical differences between the NIPAs and the ITAs are generally resolved during benchmark revisions of the NIPAs (which generally occur every 5 years and which incorporate revisions as far back as necessary).21 However, the adjustments and other differences described below will 19 See “Best level and best change” in Chapter 4. 20 The revision period for BEA’s estimates was expanded from 3 to 5 years as part of the 2018 comprehensive update of the NIPAs. BEA’s flexible approach to annual updates is described in “BEA Briefing: Improving BEA’s Accounts Through Flexible Annual Revisions,” Survey 88 (June 2008): 29-32. 21 For instance, during the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, estimates from the most recent annual revision of the ITAs were incorporated into the NIPAs for only the most recent 3 years; the revisions to the ITAs for years back to 1999 were incorporated as part of the 2014 annual update of the NIPAs.

NIPA table group 4.3 provides a complete reconciliation of the differences between the NIPAs and the ITAs. Current quarterly estimates Monthly statistics on trade in goods, based on Census Bureau compilations of the customs data, and on trade in services, primarily based on BEA surveys and on data reported by other U.S. government agencies, are provided in a Census Bureau-BEA news release.22 For seasonally adjusted exports and imports of goods, the “advance” quarterly NIPA estimates are based on Census Bureau trade data for the first 2 months of the quarter and the Census advanced trade report for the 3rd month of the quarter. “Second” quarterly NIPA estimates are based on the Census Bureau data for all three months of the quarter. The “third” quarterly NIPA estimates are based on the quarterly ITAs, which incorporate revised Census Bureau data.23 For seasonally adjusted exports and imports of services, the “advance” and “second” quarterly NIPA estimates are largely based on various ITA indicator series that are used to extrapolate from the latest source data. The “third” quarterly NIPA estimates are based on the quarterly ITA estimates, which incorporate data from BEA transportation surveys, extrapolations of BEA survey data on royalties and license fees and “other” private services, and data reported by other U.S. government agencies (and which are used to revise the monthly trade data). The ITA quarterly estimates are incorporated into the NIPA estimates on a “best-change” basis.24 After the third current quarterly estimate, the NIPA estimates of net exports are not revised again until the next annual update. The not seasonally adjusted (NSA) estimates of exports and imports are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted estimates, using not seasonally adjusted source data. In addition, the adjustments and other differences that reflect the different release schedules, geographic boundaries, and treatments for certain transactions of the seasonally adjusted NIPA estimates of exports and imports and the seasonally adjusted ITA estimates are also incorporated in the not seasonally adjusted estimates (see comprehensive update.

In contrast, in the international guidelines presented in the System of Accounts 2008 (SNA), the capital account includes the net acquisition of gold and similar valuables (such as antiques and other art objects) that are held as stores of value in gross fixed capital formation as “Acquisitions less disposals of valuables.” Only a small share of the international transactions in nonmonetary gold recorded in the ITAs is for business or industrial use; most transactions are for investment or other purposes. Consequently, the NIPA estimates for exports and imports of nonmonetary gold are not based on the ITA estimates. Instead, the NIPAs incorporate a special adjustment for transactions in gold. The NIPA estimates for gold begin with an estimate of domestic production of gold, which is included in GDP and in the associated gross domestic income for gold. Domestic gold production is measured as the sum of mine production of gold and of secondary production of gold in the United States multiplied by the average price of gold.28 Annual and quarterly estimates of gold production are based on data provided by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Mineral Industry Surveys—Precious Metals. The average price of gold is based on the producer price index for metal ore mining from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Part of domestic gold production is for domestic industrial use (that is, business transactions in gold used for production of final goods, such as jewelry, specialty coins, and medals and for electronics and dental applications). Annual and quarterly estimates of industrial demand for gold are derived using World Gold Council (WGC) data on gold used for production multiplied by the average price of gold. The difference between domestic gold production and industrial demand for gold is entered into the NIPAs in the form of an adjustment to net exports: specifically, the adjustment consists of removing the ITA estimates of exports (line 2) and imports (line 20) of nonmonetary gold and of adding “Gold, NIPAs” (line 22) to imports with its sign reversed.29 This treatment maintains the relationship of GDP to gross domestic purchases (gross domestic purchases is equal to GDP minus net exports) while protecting the integrity of the other final expenditures components of GDP.30 27 Because source data do not allow a complete accounting of valuables for the United States, investments in valuables are not included in the NIPAs. See “Asset boundary” in Chapter 2. 28 Secondary production of gold is the supply of gold available from scrap (used gold). 29 Thus, if domestic gold production exceeds industrial demand for gold (as it has since 1987), the excess supply of gold is available for export or for use as a store of valuables by domestic investors. If industrial demand exceeds domestic production, the gap in the supply of gold would need to be filled by imports or through the sale of gold by domestic investors. 30 This treatment is not strictly appropriate for analyses of international competitiveness, but its effects will not be significant as long as the net values remain small and stable.",

The lines in table 8.2 for “statistical differences” reconcile the different revision cycles of the NIPAs and the ITAs discussed earlier. Adjustment for U.S. territories (lines 4, 9, 23, and 27). As discussed earlier, the “U.S. estimates” for the NIPAs cover the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. military installations, embassies, and consulates abroad, while the “U.S. estimates” for the ITAs include these geographical areas as well as commonwealths and territories of the United States. Therefore, an adjustment must be made to the ITA statistics to make the geographic coverage consistent with the NIPA coverage. In practice, the adjustment is made only for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; the value of trade with other U.S. territories and commonwealths is relatively small. The adjustment consists of adding the value of U.S. trade with Puerto Rico and with the U.S. Virgin Islands to the ITA estimates and of deducting the value of their trade with the rest of the world from the ITA estimates. For U.S. exports and imports of goods to and from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and for exports and imports between them and the rest of the world, the annual and quarterly estimates for the adjustments are based on Census Bureau data on trade in goods. For exports and imports of services, the annual estimates of the value of U.S. exports to, and imports from, Puerto Rico are based on BEA’s Puerto Rico GDP statistics, and the quarterly estimates are based on judgmental trend. There is no territorial adjustment in the NIPAs for U.S. services exported to, or imported from, the U.S. Virgin Islands; however, the data for exports and imports of goods suggest that the value for services is very small. There is also no adjustment for the value of trade in services between either Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands and the rest of the world; total trade data suggest that these values are also very small. Adjustment for other items (line 8). In the ITAs, certain military grant transfers were treated as exports of services. In the NIPAs, some transfers of services under military grant programs, such as peace and humanitarian operations, are included in federal government transfer payments. Thus, an adjustment is made to remove these transfers from the ITA data on exports of services. Quantity and price estimates In general, the estimates of quantities purchased, or real spending, for the most detailed components of most exports and imports are prepared by deflation. In the deflation method, the quantities are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by an appropriate price index. For most categories of exports and imports of goods, the price indexes are BLS export and import price indexes. However, for several categories of capital goods that",

Quality-adjusted prices from the Federal Reserve Board are used in deflating selected components of exports and imports of telecommunications equipment. A BLS producer price index is used to deflate exports of semiconductors.31 A BLS consumer price index for smartphones is used to deflate components of imports of other durable household goods.32 BEA quality-adjusted price indexes are used to deflate imports of photocopier equipment33 and exports and imports of scientific, hospital, and medical equipment. Finally, several types of exports and imports of transportation equipment are deflated using specific PPIs, because export and import price indexes are not available at that level of detail.34 For most categories of services, BLS export or import prices are not available. Instead, PPIs, consumer price indexes, or BEA composite indexes of prices or of input costs are used for deflation.35 In addition, the quantity estimates for several categories of exports and imports are prepared using methods other than deflation. For example, the quantity estimates for petroleum and petroleum products imports are prepared using direct valuation—that is, by multiplying the base-year price by the current-period quantity data. (For general descriptions of the above methods, see “Estimates for detailed components” in Chapter 4.) The aggregate measures of exports and imports are calculated from the detailed components as chain-type quantity and price indexes (for information about these calculations, see “Estimates for NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 4). BEA also prepares measures of real exports and imports and their components in a dollar-denominated form, designated “chained-dollar” estimates (see “Chained-dollar measures” in Chapter 4). Net exports in chained dollars is calculated as the difference between chained-dollar exports and chained-dollar imports—that is, real net exports is derived as the difference between real exports and real imports.36 31 See Robert P. Parker and Eugene P. Seskin, “Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 77 (August 1997): 30. 32 “Other durable household goods” includes smartphones; for more information on the indexes used to deflate purchases of cellular telephones, see Jason W. Chute, Stephanie H. McCulla, and Shelly Smith, “Preview of the 2018 Comprehensive Update of the National Income and Product Accounts: Changes in Methods, Definitions, and Presentations,” Survey 98 (April 2018) 33 See Carol E. Moylan and Brooks B. Robinson, “Preview of the 2003 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: Statistical Changes,” Survey 83 (September 2003): 30. 34 For goods, the deflation is carried out for 107 categories of exports and for 110 categories of imports. 35 For services, the deflation is carried out for 35 categories of exports and for 35 categories of imports. 36 The Fisher formula cannot be used to compute quantity and price indexes for “net exports” because it would require taking the square root of a negative number.

Government consumption expenditures consists of spending by government to produce and provide services to the public, such as national defense and public school education. Gross investment consists of spending by government for fixed assets that directly benefit the public, such as highway construction, or that assist government agencies in their production activities, such as purchases of military hardware. Government activity—at the federal, state, and local levels—affects the economy in many ways. As noted above, governments contribute to economic output when they provide services to the public and when they invest in capital. They also provide social benefits, such as social security and Medicare, to households. Governments also affect the economy through taxes and by providing incentives for various business activities. In addition, governments affect the economy through their collective saving, the difference between their revenue and spending.1 BEA prepares estimates of government consumption expenditures and gross investment for the federal government sector and for the state and local government sector.2 Estimates of government consumption expenditures and gross investment by function—such as defense, health, and education—provide information on how governments allocate their funds. The full array of government estimates is particularly 1 The estimates of government current receipts and expenditures are presented in NIPA table 3.1.

In addition, the estimates of gross investment by government provide the building blocks for the estimates of government-owned fixed assets in BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts.4 Definitions and Concepts In the NIPAs, government is treated as a producer that uses labor, capital, and intermediate inputs to provide goods and services on behalf of the general public. In its role as a producer, value added by government measures the contribution of the government sector to total value added across all industries, which is equal to GDP. In addition, government is treated as either a consumer of, or an investor in, many of the goods and services that it produces. In its role as a consumer/investor, government consumption expenditures and gross investment measures the portion of final expenditures for GDP that is accounted for by the government sector. (For a discussion of the three methods for measuring GDP, see Chapter 2.) In the NIPAs, the framework for government consumption expenditures explicitly recognizes government as a producer of goods and services (table 9.1). The gross output of general government consists of all of the goods and services produced by general government (see the box “General Government and Government Enterprises” on the next page). The value of this output is measured by the cost of inputs—that is, as the sum of employee compensation, of consumption of fixed capital (CFC), and of intermediate goods and services purchased.5 This framework is parallel to the concepts and presentation of output and intermediate inputs of private business (and of government enterprises) in BEA’s input-output accounts and GDP-by-industry accounts. However, 3 See Mark S. Ludwick and Benjamin A. Mandel, “Analyzing Federal Programs Using BEA Statistics: A Look at Unemployment Insurance Benefits Payments,” Survey of Current Business 91 (September 2011): 14-17. 4 As noted in Chapter 2, fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in the production process—that is, in the production of other goods (including other fixed assets) or of services— for more than 1 year. For a description of the methodology for BEA’s estimates of the stocks and depreciation of fixed assets and of the investment flows used to derive them, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States 1925–97, September 2003, available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 5 CFC, or depreciation, measures the decline in the value of the stock of fixed assets due to physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, and accidental damage; however, it does not include losses caused by a natural disaster or war losses of military equipment. CFC for general government provides a partial measure of the services derived from government capital investment—that is, of the value added (measured as the expense incurred) as a result of using government capital goods in the production of services. (CFC is only a partial measure because the rate of return on government assets is assumed to be zero.)",

General Government and Government Enterprises Government output is divided into market and nonmarket output. Most government output is nonmarket in nature, meaning that services, such as public education and law enforcement, are provided without charge or with only a nominal charge. The nonmarket output of the government sector is classified in the NIPAs as general government output. In contrast, certain government entities provide goods and services that are sold directly to households and businesses in market transactions that recover all or a considerable portion of their operating costs. In the NIPAs, these entities are called government enterprises. Generally, government enterprises provide services in the market economy because special circumstances—such as natural monopolies and externalities—prevent private companies from doing so. In addition, government enterprises may undertake projects of a scale too large for the private sector, or they may perform a public service that would result in operating losses if performed by the private sector. The largest government enterprise is the United States Postal Service. Other federal government enterprises include power authorities, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, and insurance enterprises, such as the National Flood Insurance Program. State and local government enterprises include housing authorities, transit systems, airports, water ports, and utilities. In the NIPAs, the value added by government enterprises (as producers of goods and services for the marketplace) is recorded in the business sector, along with that of private businesses. Sales of goods and services by government enterprises to persons are recorded as personal consumption expenditures, and those to businesses are recorded as intermediate purchases. However, the NIPA presentation of fixed investment, as with a number of other NIPA-table presentations, is split between “private” and “government” (rather than between “business” and “general government”), so the gross investment of government enterprises is included with that of general government.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 9: GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND GROSS INVESTMENT 9-4 Measuring the Output of Governments Difficult conceptual and practical problems arise in measuring the output of governments, primarily because most of this output is not sold in the marketplace (see the box “General Government and Government Enterprises”). Among these problems are the measurement of nonmarket services and the measurement of change over time in the real services provided by government. For the nonmarket services produced by general government, standard practice as recommended by the System of National Accounts is to value output in terms of the input costs incurred in production.6 These costs include labor, materials, and supplies, and they also include the use of fixed capital. BEA uses a depreciation measure known as “consumption of fixed capital” as a partial measure of the annual services produced by the existing stock of government fixed capital; this approach implicitly assumes that the net return for general government fixed assets is zero. In contrast, the cost of capital services for private market producers includes a positive net return. Alternatively, BEA could augment its measure of capital services by including a net return on assets, a change that would tend to raise the overall level of government output and consumption expenditures, and thus GDP. Several approaches have been suggested: using a private sector rate of return, a municipal bond rate, the Office of Management and Budget hurdle rate for investment, or others.7 For real services provided by government, BEA’s estimates of real government consumption expenditures are generally based on changes in the real inputs, and thus assume that there is no change in productivity. If possible, it would be preferable to measure actual changes in the quantity or volume of the services provided, thus allowing for changes in productivity. Some services, such as national defense, are pure public goods and are difficult to quantify, even in theory. However, other services, particularly for state and local governments, can be measured directly: for example, number of criminals arrested, number of fires extinguished, number of students educated, or number of patients treated. Some countries, including the United Kingdom, use caseload numbers as a way of quantifying real government output directly, but such measures have been subject to criticism. BEA has conducted research in a number of areas pertaining to alternative measures of real government output.8 This research is currently preliminary, and further research is needed before these measures can be considered for implementation in the national accounts. 6 Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008): 2.59. 7 M.

Thus, in order to avoid double counting in calculating GDP, own-account investment by general government, as measured by input costs, is subtracted from general government gross output in deriving government consumption expenditures. The value of the services that are provided by government free of charge, whether to individual members of society (such as education at public elementary schools) or to society as a whole (such as national defense or law enforcement), is included in government consumption expenditures. In effect, government is treated as the final purchaser of these services. For services that are provided by government at a reduced charge (such as tuition paid to public universities), the fees paid by the public are recorded as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) if paid by persons or as intermediate inputs if paid by business. Thus, in order to avoid double counting in calculating GDP, the portion of the value of the output of services that is covered by fees is recorded as “sales to other sectors” and is subtracted from gross output of general government in deriving 9 The relatively small amount of noninvestment goods, such as books, that are produced by general government is included in services.",

The remaining value of this output—that is, the difference between the costs incurred in providing the services and the fees collected for the services—is included in government consumption expenditures. In effect, government is treated as the final purchaser of the portion of these services that is not sold to the public. Government gross investment is a measure of the additions to, and replacements of, the stock of government-owned fixed assets.10 It consists of investment by both general government and government enterprises in structures (such as highways and schools), in equipment (such as military hardware), and in intellectual property products (software and research and development), and it includes own-account investment by government. Federally funded expenditures for research and development (R&D) are treated as government investment, regardless of whether the R&D is protected or made freely available to the public, because the provision of public services is part of the economic benefits generated by government R&D.11 Federally funded R&D is supported through purchases or through grants. For purchases, ownership by the federal government is usually straightforward, because the federal government normally retains ownership of the outcome of the purchased R&D. For grants, both the federal government and the performer of the R&D can benefit from the transaction, but they are treated as federal government R&D because the federal government receives economic benefits and because of the difficulty in distinguishing ownership between the funder and the performer of the R&D in the source data. Table 9.2 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, government consumption expenditures and gross investment. 10 Unlike measures of gross private domestic investment, government gross investment excludes the change in inventories. Government expenditures on inventories are treated as current account purchases because data are generally not available to produce a comprehensive measure of government inventory investment or of inventory depreciation. 11 This treatment is consistent with recommendations of the SNA 2008 paragraphs 6.230, 10.103.",

In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, it appears as a component of final expenditures in the Domestic Income and Product Account (account 1). In the Government Receipts and Expenditures Account (account 4), government consumption expenditures appears as a current expenditure. In the Domestic Capital Account (account 6), government fixed investment appears as a component of gross domestic investment; in addition, government CFC is added to net saving in the calculation of gross saving.

The tables present nominal, or “current-dollar” measures, “real,” or inflation-adjusted measures, and price indexes. Current-dollar estimates of government current receipts and expenditures that are not seasonally adjusted are also available in this section. In addition, estimates of investment by government in fixed assets are presented as part of BEA’s fixed assets and consumer durable goods accounts.12 Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier in the handbook, the NIPA estimates, including those for government consumption expenditures and gross investment, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods”). Tables 9.A (government consumption expenditures) and 9.B (gross investment) at the end of this chapter summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current- dollar benchmark estimates, nonbenchmark annual estimates, and current quarterly estimates, as well as the quantity and price indexes, for the categories shown in NIPA table groups 3.9 and 3.10. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. The estimates of government consumption expenditures and gross investment are prepared separately for the federal government and for the combined state and local governments.13 • For the federal government, the major sources for the estimates of consumption expenditures and gross investment are federal financial documents, primarily the Budget of the United States Government, an annual document published by the Executive Office of the President, and the Department of the Treasury’s Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays (MTS), which presents monthly data on federal agency expenditures in a budget framework but in considerably less detail than is available in the fiscal year budget. Additional source data come from many federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD), the Social 12 These estimates are available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 13 In general, the NIPA estimates for state government and for local government are combined. However, aggregate annual estimates of current-dollar consumption expenditures and of current-dollar gross investment are provided separately for state government and for local government in NIPA tables 3.20 and 3.21, respectively. These tables of state government and of local government receipts and expenditures are published a few months after the initial release of the NIPA annual update.",

Additional data come from many other federal agencies and from a number of private sources. Benchmark-year and nonbenchmark-year estimates Federal In general, the benchmark and nonbenchmark annual NIPA estimates are prepared using data from U.S. Treasury financial reports and agency administrative reports in conjunction with detailed information from BEA’s translation of the President’s budget into a NIPA basis (see the box “NIPA Translation of the Federal Budget” below). The budget translation provides a detailed array of NIPA expenditures by program and by type of expenditure that is used as the basis for allocating the data on program outlays from the MTS to consumption expenditures and gross investment and to other expenditures, such as social benefits and subsidies. Supplemental data from other government sources are then used to estimate spending by type of consumption expenditure and gross investment. Estimates of federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment are prepared separately for defense and for nondefense. The defense category consists of the activities covered by the national defense function in the budget—that is, DOD military activities, defense-related atomic energy activities of the Department of Energy, and defense-related activities of other agencies. The nondefense category consists of the other consumption and investment activities in the budget.",

For many goods and for some services, the estimates are prepared using a “direct-pricing” method—that is, as the product of a delivered quantity times the actual price paid.14 For compensation, the estimates of wages and salaries of military employees are based on federal budget data, and the estimates of supplements are primarily based on data from SSA and DOD, including the actuarial report for the military retirement fund. The estimates of wages and salaries of civilian defense employees are based on data from the BLS quarterly census of employment and wages (QCEW), and the estimates of supplements are based on data from SSA, from the Office of Personnel Management, including actuarial reports for the major civilian employee retirement plans, and from the Thrift Investment Board. The estimates of CFC are derived using the perpetual inventory 14 For more information, see MP-5: Government Transactions, II-33. NIPA Translation of the Federal Budget Each year, BEA prepares a “translation” of the information in the President’s fiscal year budget into a NIPA framework (see the annual article on the NIPA translation of the federal budget, which is usually published in the March issue of the Survey of Current Business). Unlike the federal budget, which is a financial plan of the government, the NIPA federal-sector estimates are designed to facilitate macroeconomic analyses of the effects of federal government activity on economic activity. The translation is based on actual budget data on receipts and outlays for the preceding fiscal year and on projected and proposed receipts and outlays for the current and the next fiscal year. In translating the budget data into the framework of the NIPAs, three primary types of adjustments are made. These adjustments result in NIPA estimates of current receipts and expenditures that differ from corresponding estimates of receipts and expenditures in the budget. • Coverage adjustments account for certain transactions that are included in the budget but are excluded from the NIPAs (and vice versa). For example, the NIPA estimates include consumption of fixed capital, but the budget does not. • Netting and grossing adjustments account for certain transactions that are recorded as offsets to outlays in the budget but are recorded as receipts in the NIPAs (and vice versa). • Timing adjustments account for certain transactions that are recorded on a cash basis in the budget but are recorded on an accrual basis in the NIPAs.",

Whenever possible, the direct-pricing method is used to prepare the estimates. The estimates of defense research and development (R&D) are based on R&D expenditures data from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) annual Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development. Nondefense estimates For most categories of nondefense consumption expenditures other than compensation and CFC, the estimates are primarily based on the federal budget data. For compensation, the estimates of wages and salaries for federal nondefense employees are based on QCEW data, and the estimates of supplements are primarily based on data from SSA, from the Office of Personnel Management, including actuarial reports for the major civilian employee retirement plans, and from the Thrift Investment Board. As above, the estimates of CFC are derived using the perpetual inventory method. For nondefense gross investment, the estimates for structures are primarily based on Census Bureau construction statistics, and the estimates for equipment are primarily based on federal budget data, supplemented with data from various federal agencies when available. The benchmark-year estimates for software are primarily based on receipts data from the Census Bureau’s economic census, and the estimates for nonbenchmark years are primarily based on receipts data from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey The estimates for research and development (R&D) are based on R&D expenditures data from the following NSF annual surveys: the Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development and the Higher Education Research and Development Survey. As explained earlier, federal purchases of, and grants for, R&D are both treated as investment by the federal sector.

It covers all the states and over 90,000 local governments— including, counties, municipalities, townships, special districts, and school 15 For more information on the derivation of the CFC estimates for government fixed assets, see Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, 1925–97, September 2003.",

Data are reported for each government’s annual accounting period (fiscal year) that ends on or before June 30 of the census year. • The GF data are compiled from three sources: an enumeration of all the states, a sample survey of local governments, and data from federal government agencies. Data are reported for each government’s fiscal year that ends on or before June 30 of the survey year. Generally, it takes about 2 years from the close of each fiscal year for final tabulations of the COG and GF data to become available. Because the fiscal years for many state and local governments do not coincide with the calendar year, the incorporation of the COG/GF data may affect the estimates for more than one calendar year. For example, in the 2020 annual update of the NIPAs, the estimates for calendar year 2017 (the third annual update of those estimates) were prepared using final FY 2017 GF data, and preliminary FY 2018 data. The estimates for calendar year 2018 (the second annual update of those estimates) were prepared using preliminary FY 2018 data and BEA projections for FY 2019. The estimates for calendar year 2019 (the first annual update of those estimates) were based on BEA projections for FY 2019 and FY 2020. For compensation, the estimates of wages and salaries for state and local government employees are based on QCEW data. Estimates of accrual-based pension contributions are drawn from a sample of actuarial reports from state pension systems. Other estimates of supplements are primarily based on data from the SSA, from the Department of Labor, from the COG/GF, and from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. For CFC, the estimates are derived using the perpetual inventory method. Estimates by function The annual estimates of federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment by function are prepared on the basis of functional classifications for each appropriation in the federal budget. The portions of spending for all appropriations that are estimated by BEA to be consumption expenditures and gross investment are summed by budget function and then aggregated into classifications that are largely consistent with the System of National Account’s “Classification of the Functions of Government” (COFOG). Sales of government services by appropriation are also assigned to budget functions and are subtracted from gross expenditures. In addition, a BEA estimate of CFC is added to each function.16 The annual estimates of state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment by function are based on COG/GF data by function. These data are adjusted to conform to NIPA accounting concepts and then sorted into COFOG-based functions. 16 See Karl Galbraith, “Government Spending by Function: A New Presentation,” Survey 80 (June 2000): 18–23.

In addition, a BEA estimate of CFC is added to each function.17 Current quarterly estimates Source data that underlie the estimates of federal and state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment include a variety of seasonally-adjusted and unadjusted data. BEA tests the estimates for seasonality using the Census X-13 ARIMA program, and it seasonally adjusts them wherever seasonality is found. For those estimates where no seasonality is detected, the seasonally adjusted estimates are equal to the not seasonally adjusted estimates. In most cases, the not seasonally adjusted estimates of federal and state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment are derived using the same source data and methods that underlie the seasonally adjusted estimates. Where different source data are used, the difference is noted in tables 9.A and 9.B. Federal For defense consumption expenditures other than compensation and CFC, the current quarterly estimates for most categories are based on MTS data on budget outlays and on DOD data from financial reports on disbursements and are supplemented with other information from DOD when available. For nondefense consumption expenditures other than compensation and CFC, the current quarterly estimates for most categories of goods are based on MTS data on budget outlays. The estimates for most categories of services are based on judgmental trend. Although the MTS is the primary source for many of the NIPA estimates of federal consumption expenditures, it is important to note that critical differences in definition and coverage limit the usefulness of the MTS as an early indicator of movements in the NIPA measures. For example, current transfer payments, which account for a significant part of the federal budget, are not counted as production and are therefore excluded from the NIPA measures of consumption expenditures. 18 For compensation, the current quarterly estimates for military employees are based on DOD employment data. The estimates for civilian defense employees and for nondefense employees are based on an indicator series that is derived using changes in BLS current employment statistics. For CFC, the estimates are derived as part of the perpetual inventory method that is used to prepare BEA’s estimates of the net stocks of fixed assets. 17 See Galbraith, 18–23, and see also Baker, Kelly, and Robinson, 5–10. 18 For more information, see the box “The Monthly Treasury Statement and BEA’s Estimates of Federal Government Spending,” in “Business Situation: Advance Estimates for the Fourth Quarter of 2005 and for 2005,” Survey 86 (February 2006): 6.",

State and local For most categories of state and local consumption expenditures other than compensation and CFC, the current quarterly estimates are derived by first preparing the quantity estimates and then “reflating” those estimates to current dollars by multiplying them by appropriate price indexes (generally BLS producer price indexes or consumer price indexes). For compensation, the current quarterly estimates are based on an indicator series that is derived using changes in BLS current employment statistics and changes in the BLS employment cost index. For CFC, the estimates are derived as part of the perpetual inventory method that is used to prepare BEA’s estimates of the net stocks of fixed assets. For gross investment, the estimates for structures, which account for over three- fourths of total investment, are based on Census Bureau monthly construction statistics. The estimates for investment in motor vehicles reflect monthly data on new motor vehicle registrations by state and local governments from R.L. Polk and Company. The estimates for other equipment and for intellectual property products are primarily based on judgmental trend. Quantity and price estimates The estimates of quantities purchased, or real spending, for most of the detailed government consumption expenditures and gross investment categories except compensation and CFC are prepared by deflation. Under this method, the quantities are calculated by dividing the current-dollar value of the component by an appropriate price index (with the reference year set equal to 100). For many defense categories, particularly for equipment, BEA directly prepares detailed price indexes based on DOD delivery and price information. In addition, as mentioned above, the current quarterly quantity estimates for most of the state and local government components are prepared by quantity extrapolation. The quantity and price estimates of compensation for military employees are prepared by quantity extrapolation using an indicator derived from DOD employment data, and the quantity and price estimates for federal civilian employees and for state and local government employees are prepared by quantity extrapolation using an indicator derived from BLS employment data.

It is the largest component of gross domestic income (GDI), of national income, and of personal income in the U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs). Compensation estimates are an integral part of the NIPAs, a set of accounts that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts”). BEA’s measures of compensation provide comprehensive and consistent economic measures of the income earned by all U.S. workers. In contrast to other available measures of compensation, the NIPA measures include not just wages and salaries but also noncash benefits—such as employer contributions to pension plans, to health insurance, and to social insurance programs. Thus, the NIPA measures of compensation are particularly useful in analyses of labor’s share in the functional distribution of income. Additionally, unit labor costs— the ratio of compensation to real output—is an important indicator of potential inflation. Moreover, analyses of the components and supporting detail underlying the compensation measures are useful for considering the differences between the individual experiences of households and the picture of the economy captured in broader aggregates such as GDP and personal income. The estimates of wages and salaries—the largest component of compensation—are critical for projecting federal budgets and Social Security trust fund balances.1 Additionally, BEA prepares associated measures of employment and hours. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the principal provider of information on the labor market in the United States (including detailed data on employment, hours, and earnings), BEA’s supplemental measures are consistent with the NIPA compensation measures and therefore facilitate analyses of NIPA-based compensation and productivity by employee. These measures are described in appendix A to this chapter; they include full-time equivalent employees and hours worked. 1 See J. Steven Landefeld, Brent R. Moulton, Joel D. Platt, and Shaunda M. Villones, “GDP and Beyond: Measuring Economic Progress and Sustainability,” Survey of Current Business 90 (April 2010): 12-25.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-2 Definitions and Concepts Compensation measures the total remuneration, in cash or in kind, that accrues to employees in return for their work during the accounting period, regardless of when they are paid. As such, the NIPA treatment of compensation is consistent with the treatment recommended by the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA), in which compensation reflects total remuneration and is measured on an accrual basis.2 Compensation consists of the earnings of employees, but it does not include the earnings of the self-employed, which the NIPAs treat as proprietors’ income (and the SNA treats as mixed income). Compensation is equal to the sum of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries. Wages and salaries, which generally accounts for over 80 percent of compensation, consists of cash remuneration of labor (including sick or vacation pay, severance pay, commissions, tips, and bonuses), and in-kind remuneration of labor such as transit subsidies and meals. Supplements to wages and salaries consists of employer payments that are made on behalf of employees but are not included in the regular wage payments provided directly to employees—specifically, employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance. Because these payments are made for the benefit of employees and because the value of the contributions is typically determined, in some fashion, by their labor, they are treated as compensation. Table 10.1 shows the kinds of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, compensation of employees. Table 10.1—Content of Compensation of Employees Category of transaction Comments Wages and salaries in cash Includes monetary wages and salaries payable by employers to employees and to corporate officers at regular intervals, including piecework payments; overtime or unusual-hour payments; payments for periods away from work due to temporary discontinuation of production, such as holidays or absences for illness; allowances for unusual location or conditions; early retirement (buyout) payments; severance pay; jury, witness, and other compensatory fees; and regular supplementary allowances, such as housing allowances.3 Includes incentive payments, commissions, tips, and bonuses payable to employees and to corporate officers. Includes employee gains from exercising nonqualified stock options (NSOs).4 2 See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008: 7.5. For a discussion of the accrual and cash methods of accounting, see “Accounting principles” in Chapter 2. 3 The source data underlying the estimates of wages and salaries do not provide the separate estimates of severance payments or of payments for time away due to illness or injury that are required for excluding them from compensation (as the SNA recommends), so they are included in the NIPA measures of compensation. 4 NSOs are regarded as additional, taxable, income at the time they are exercised; in contrast, incentive stock options do not require the reporting of additional income and are taxed as long-term capital gains when sold. The detailed data required for treating NSOs as compensation of employees when the options are granted (as the SNA recommends) are not currently available. Instead, NSOs are valued at the time that they are exercised, and the difference between the market price at the time of the exercise and the price paid by the employee at the time of the exercise is recorded as wages and salaries.

Excludes the income received by the owners or associated household members of unincorporated enterprises, which is treated as proprietors’ income. Excludes the income received by tax-exempt cooperatives, which is treated as proprietors’ income. Excludes reimbursement by employers of expenditures made by employees in order to carry out their work (such as purchases of tools and equipment), which are treated as intermediate expenditures by the employer. Wages and salaries in kind Includes employer-provided in-kind earnings, such as transit subsidies, meals, and lodging. Excludes goods or services that employers must provide in order for employees to perform their work, which are treated as intermediate expenditures by the employer. Supplements to wages and salaries Includes employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds: private pension plans, government employee pension plans, private insurance funds such as group health and life insurance, workers’ compensation, supplemental unemployment insurance, and publicly administered government employee insurance plans. Includes employer contributions for government social insurance: old age, survivors, and disability insurance (social security); hospital insurance; unemployment insurance; railroad retirement; pension benefit guaranty; veterans life insurance; workers’ compensation; military medical insurance; and temporary disability insurance. Employers provide employees with pension benefits largely through two mechanisms: • Defined contribution plans provide benefits during retirement based on the amount of money that has accumulated in an employee’s account as a result of employer and employee contributions to the plans and the income earned from investment of the plans’ assets. • Defined benefit plans provide benefits during retirement based on a formula that typically depends on an employee’s length of service and average pay, among other factors. To fund promised benefits to retirees, defined benefit plans primarily rely on contributions from employers and employees and on the income earned on the financial assets that the plans hold. The contributions made by employers to both types of plans are included in supplements to wages and salaries; the interest and dividend income earned on the plans’ financial assets are included in personal interest income. The NIPAs provide two measures of compensation in order to distinguish the compensation earned by all of the employees of resident U.S. employers from the compensation earned by resident U.S. employees from all employers. “Compensation of employees, paid” is the NIPA measure of the compensation paid by U.S. resident employers to their resident and nonresident employees.

That is, it excludes compensation paid to the rest of the world, and it includes compensation received from the rest of the world. Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy. In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, “compensation of employees, paid” appears as a component of GDI in the Domestic Income and Product Account (account 1) and “compensation of employees” appears in the Personal Income and Outlay Account (account 3) as a component of personal income. 6 Additionally, as “compensation of employees” reflects the compensation liabilities of both resident and nonresident employers, it appears as a component of national income.7 The NIPAs present current-dollar annual estimates of GDI by type of income, national income by type of income, and national income by sector and legal form of organization. • The presentation of GDI by type of income includes “compensation of employees, paid” and selected aggregate components—wages and salaries to persons, wages and salaries to the rest of the world, and supplements to wages and salaries. • The presentation of national income by type of income includes “compensation of employees” and selected aggregate components—wages and salaries for government and for the aggregate of all other sectors and supplements to wages and salaries from employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and from employer contributions for government social insurance. • The presentation of national income by sector and legal form of organization also includes “compensation of employees” and selected aggregate components—wages and salaries and supplements to wages and salaries. Additionally, annual estimates of “compensation of employees,” wages and salaries, and the major components of supplements to wages and salaries are presented by industry. 5 Compensation paid to the rest of the world consists of compensation paid to foreign residents temporarily working in the United States (including undocumented migratory workers) and to Canadian and Mexican workers who commute to work in the United States. Compensation received from the rest of the world consists of compensation received by U.S. residents temporarily working abroad, working in foreign diplomatic installations, or working for international organizations in the United States, and by workers from the United States who commute to Mexico or Canada. 6 In addition, compensation of general government employees is a product-side component of government consumption expenditures and gross investment in account 1; see “Chapter 9: Government Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment” for more information on the NIPA presentation of government as both a consumer/investor and a producer and on the measurement of government output as the sum of the cost of its inputs. 7 For a discussion of the relationship between GDP, gross national product, national income, and other important NIPA aggregates, see “Major NIPA aggregates” in Chapter 2.

The following is a list of the principal NIPA tables that present current-dollar estimates of compensation as a component of GDI and of national income. 10 1.10 Gross Domestic Income by Type of Income 1.11 Percentage Shares of Gross Domestic Income 1.12 National Income by Type of Income11 1.13 National Income by Sector, Legal Form of Organization, and Type of Income 6.2 Compensation of Employees by Industry 6.3 Wages and Salaries by Industry Annual estimates of supplements to wages and salaries are also presented by industry and by detailed type of supplement in the following NIPA tables: 8 For descriptions of NIPA sectors and of legal forms of organization, see the section “Classification” in. 9 Time-series breaks caused by the conversion to NAICS and by previous revisions to the SIC are reflected in the separation of estimates into distinct tables for each range of estimates based on a different classification. For instance, table 6.2, Compensation of Employees by Industry, comprises four separate tables: table 6.2A, based on the 1942 SIC; table 6.2B, based on the 1972 SIC; table 6.2C, based on the 1987 SIC; and table 6.2D, based on the 2012 NAICS. For more information on the conversion from the SIC to NAICS, see John R. Kort, “The North American Industry Classification System in BEA’s Economic Accounts,” Survey 81 (May 2001): 7–13. 10 As a component of the product-side measure of government consumption expenditures and gross investment, BEA prepares real (inflation-adjusted) measures of the compensation of general government employees. For more information on the derivation of inflation-adjusted measures, see “Price and Quantity Estimates” in “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods.” For more information on the derivation of real compensation of general government employees, see the section “Quantity and price estimates” in Chapter 9, and see Bruce E. Baker and Pamela A. Kelly, “A Primer on BEA’s Government Accounts,” Survey 88 (March 2008): 29-38. 11 The NIPAs also present annual and quarterly estimates of “compensation of employees” in NIPA table group 2 as a component of personal income. Annual and quarterly estimates of “compensation of employees” are available in NIPA table 2.1. Personal Income and Its Disposition. Annual and quarterly estimates of wages and salaries are available by aggregate industry groupings in NIPA table 2.2. Wages and Salaries by Industry. Monthly estimates of wages and salaries by aggregate industry groupings are available in NIPA table 2.7. Wages and Salaries by Industry, Monthly.

Specifically, the compensation estimates are based on statistical reports from federal agencies including BLS and the Department of the Treasury, on federal budget publications and other administrative and regulatory agency reports, and on reports from private organizations (such as trade associations). Tables 10.A (wages and salaries), 10.B (employer contributions for pension and insurance funds), and 10.C (employer contributions for government social insurance) at the end of this chapter summarize the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the annual estimates and the current quarterly estimates of compensation and its components. The tables follow the categories shown in NIPA tables 6.3 (for wages and salaries), 6.11 (for employer contributions for pension and insurance funds), and 3.6 (for employer contributions for government social insurance).15 The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Annual estimates “Compensation of employees, paid” is measured as the sum of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries. The primary source of information on annual wages and salaries is the QCEW; the sources of information on supplements to wages and salaries are as varied as the programs themselves. Wages and salaries The benchmark and annual estimates are derived using the same source data and methodologies. For private industry employees and for civilian employees of federal 15 In NIPA table 6.3. Wages and Salaries by Industry,, total wages and salaries on a national income basis—which includes wages and salaries received from the rest of the world and excludes wages and salaries paid to the rest of the world—is shown on line 1. The industry-specific estimates, beginning with “Domestic industries” on line 2, include payments to the rest of the world (and exclude receipts from the rest of the world) in order to accurately reflect each industry’s total wage and salary liability. The offsetting entry, total wages and salaries paid to the rest of the world netted against wages and salaries received from the rest of the world, is shown on line 97. In NIPA table 3.6. Contributions for Government Social Insurance, the entry “Rest-of-the-world contributions” on line 32 recognizes the employer and employee contributions for government social insurance from residents of the U.S. territories of Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and of the U.S. commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. In the NIPAs, these are treated as contributions from “nonresidents” (see the section “Geographic coverage” in Chapter 2) and as a consequence, they are not included in the NIPA estimates of total supplements to wages and salaries and are not shown in table 10.C of this chapter.",

Estimates for the military and for other government enterprises are discussed below in the section “Adjustments to the QCEW data.” QCEW data on wages and salaries are generally available for all four quarters of the previous year at the time of the annual update of the NIPAs. The QCEW is a federal-state cooperative program in which state employment agencies compile and report to BLS the monthly data on employment and the quarterly data on total and taxable wages that are reported to the states each quarter by private industries on quarterly tax returns and by federal agencies and state and local governments on similar reports for employees covered by state unemployment insurance (UI) laws or by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. These data cover about 97 percent of employees on nonfarm payrolls. BLS tabulates the data by geographical categories (county, metropolitan statistical area, combined statistical area, state, and the nation), by six-digit NAICS industry level, and by ownership sectors (private industry, federal government, state government, or local government). The composition of wages reported to state employment agencies is generally consistent with the NIPA definition of wages and salaries. The data are on a disbursement basis; they reflect the total wages and salaries paid during a calendar quarter, regardless of when the services were performed (although a few state laws specify that wages be reported on an accrual basis). Conversely, the NIPAs record compensation and its components on an accrual basis; they reflect the total wages and salaries earned during the period, regardless of when they were paid. In most years, the pattern of wage and salary accruals and disbursements is relatively stable, with no difference between the measures of accruals and disbursements.16 However, when there is evidence of a substantial departure from the usual pattern, BEA may incorporate a timing adjustment to better reflect the earnings accrued in each period. When these adjustments are made, they are recorded in the annual wage reconciliation table (NIPA table 7.18) discussed below in the section “Adjustments to the QCEW data.” 17 BEA sums the quarterly QCEW data for each industry to derive annual estimates and makes additional adjustments to account for misreporting of wages on employment tax returns and for differences in coverage and in definitions (see the section “Adjustments to the QCEW 16 As a simple example, if wages and salaries accrued annually include bonuses that typically equal $100, with one- half of the bonuses paid in the current year and one-half paid in the following year, then each year’s disbursed wages will include a $50 bonus payment accrued in the current year and a $50 bonus payment accrued in the previous year; the total bonuses paid in each year—$100—equals the bonuses accrued. 17 Prior to the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, the NIPAs presented a third compensation measure, “compensation of employees, received” that reflected estimates of wages and salaries on a disbursement basis. An entry for “wage and salary accruals less disbursements” (WALD) in the national income tables reconciled the two accrual-based measures with this disbursement-based measure. In practice, there was often little information on the timing differences between accruals and disbursements, and the measure of WALD was typically zero. The new treatment, introduced during the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, discontinued the disbursement-based measure of “compensation of employees, received” and the measures of WALD in order to better align transactions of the personal income and outlays account with those of the private enterprise income account, to simplify the presentation of wages and salaries within the accounts, and to help bring the NIPAs in line with recommendations of the SNA.

    "text": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-9 data”); these adjustments account for about 5 percent of the NIPA estimate of wages and salaries. BEA uses industry payroll data from the Census Bureau’s Economic Census to aggregate the estimates across industries and levels of government to prepare estimates of total wages and salaries by legal form and sector. Supplements to wages and salaries The benchmark and annual estimates are derived using the same source data and methodologies. Employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds consists of the contributions made by private or government employers to privately administered retirement and insurance programs and by government employers to government employee pension plans and to publicly administered government employee insurance programs. Employer contributions for government social insurance consists of the contributions made by private and public employers to other publicly administered programs that provide certain social benefits, such as social security and Medicare.18 For employer contributions for pension funds, supplements are estimated by type of fund—defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans—and by employer—private plans and government employee plans. For defined contributions plans, future benefits are determined by the contributions made by employers and employees into the plan and by the income earned on the financial assets that the plans hold; therefore, actual contributions reflect the accrual accounting method. For defined benefit plans, future benefit entitlements are determined independently of actual contributions and may differ from them.19 Thus, in order to reflect the accrual accounting basis, the NIPA measures of employer contributions to defined benefit plans reflect actual contributions and—when actual contributions differ from the entitlements earned in the period—imputed contributions to reflect the value of the employers’ liability for entitlements and for the administrative expenses of the plan that are not fulfilled by actual contributions.20 The measurement of employer contributions for both types of plans are described below and in table 10.B.21 18 For descriptions of the government social insurance programs included in the NIPA measure of employer contributions for government social insurance, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, MP-5: Government Transactions (Methodology Papers: U.S. National Income and Product Accounts, September 2005). 19 This is especially true in cases where the actual contributions made by employers are sporadic. For example, employers sometimes skip contributions when the plans have enjoyed unusually good investment returns; conversely, employers sometimes make large “catch up” contributions to pay down unfunded benefit obligations. 20 In periods where actual contributions exceed the total liability of employers, imputed employer contributions will be negative. 21 The measurement of defined benefit pension plans on an accrual basis was introduced as part of the 2013 comprehensive update of the NIPAs to better align pension-related compensation with the timing of when employees earned the benefit entitlements and to be consistent with the recommendations of the SNA. The accrual- based estimates also avoid the volatility that arises when sporadic cash payments made by employers into defined benefit pension plans are used to measure compensation. For detailed information on accrual-based measures of benefit entitlements and contributions, see “Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: Changes in Definitions and Presentations,” Survey 93 (March 2013): 13-39 and Marshall B. Reinsdorf and David G. Lenze, “Defined Benefit Pensions and Household Income and Wealth,” Survey 89 (August 2009): 50-62. With the 2014 annual update of the NIPAs, defined contribution pension plans were also treated as part of the same subsector. With the 2018 comprehensive update, the valuation of state and local defined benefit pensions was changed from an accumulated benefit obligation basis to a projected benefit obligation basis.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-10 For employer contributions to defined contribution pension plans, the estimates are primarily based on survey and administrative data from government agencies—including the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, the Census Bureau, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the Employment Benefits and Security Administration (EBSA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). For employer contributions to defined benefit pension plans, the NIPA estimates are based on actuarial estimates of the present value of claims to benefits accrued through service in the current period—commonly called normal costs—primarily from PBGC, EBSA, OPM, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Defense, and reports from state and local pension plans. The employers’ portion of the liability for these claims—referred to as employers’ normal costs—reflects actual and imputed employer contributions. For privately sponsored defined benefit plans, estimates of employers’ normal costs are based on actuarial estimates of employers’ normal costs provided by the PBGC from data collected on IRS form 5500. The PBGC adjusts the estimates to include administrative expenses, and BEA adjusts the PBGC estimates to reflect a common discount rate based on the average AAA corporate bond rate published by Moody’s Investors Service. For federal government civilian employee defined benefit pension plans, estimates of employers’ normal costs are based on OPM data published in the annual actuarial reports of the major civilian retirement plans, supplemented by data from the Department of Treasury. The estimates of employers’ normal costs are scaled up slightly to account for smaller retirement plans such as those for employees of the Foreign Service and the Coast Guard that are not included in the source data. For the military defined benefit plans, estimates of employers’ normal costs are based on Department of Defense data on normal cost rates and payroll. For state and local employee defined benefit pension plans, the estimates of employers’ normal costs are based on the service costs and employee contribution data reported in state and local government financial reports. BEA adjusts the estimates to reflect the same discount rate that is used for measures of privately sponsored defined benefit plans. Separate measures of administrative expenses are based on Census Bureau data. For private insurance funds and publicly administered government employee insurance plans, estimates of employer contributions are primarily based on administrative and survey data from HHS, OPM, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and A.M. Best’s Aggregates and Averages. For employer contributions for government social insurance, estimates are derived by program. They are primarily based on administrative data from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Labor, and the Veterans’ Administration; on survey data from the Census Bureau; and on financial data from the Budget of the United States Government (Budget) as published by the Office of Management and Budget.",

For instance, the source data underlying the estimates of workers’ compensation do not include industry information, so industry ratios are derived from industry-specific data on occupational injuries and illnesses from BLS. Current quarterly estimates Current quarterly estimates of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries are published only at aggregate levels and not by detailed industries or by program. For wages and salaries, seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates are prepared by averaging the monthly estimates of wages and salaries that are released as part of BEA’s monthly personal income estimates. For the published aggregates of supplements to wages and salaries—that is, employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance—seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates are derived as the sum of the components (or some aggregate level of the components) that are, in most cases, prepared by extrapolation, either judgmentally or by using an indicator series (for an explanation of this method, see “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in Chapter 4).22 Wages and salaries As noted above, the primary source for the annual estimates of private wages and salaries is QCEW data. Because these quarterly data are generally available 5 months after the end of a quarter, the estimates of private wages and salaries for the quarters for which the QCEW data are not yet available are derived by averaging the current monthly estimates.23 The current monthly estimates are extrapolated for each industry from the historical monthly estimates, which are in turn based on the most recent quarterly QCEW data that are available; the industry estimates are then summed to derive the monthly estimates for total wages and salaries. The extrapolation is based on the most recent monthly data from the BLS current employment statistics (CES) program and is calculated as the growth rate for employment times average weekly hours times and average hourly earnings. Similarly, once the QCEW data are incorporated into the quarterly estimates, the monthly estimates are interpolated based on the same CES indicator series. For example, the end-of-November release of Personal Income and Outlays for October contains monthly estimates of wages and salaries for July through October that are CES extrapolations of revised monthly estimates for the second quarter that are based on newly available QCEW data. In turn, the end-of-November release of GDP for the third quarter (second estimate) contains third-quarter estimates of wages and salaries that are derived by averaging the monthly Personal Income and Outlay estimates. 22 Most of the source data that are used for extrapolation are seasonally adjusted; when this is not the case, BEA seasonally adjusts data that display seasonality (see the section “Seasonal adjustment” in Chapter 2). In cases where estimates are extrapolated without the use of indicator series, there is no monthly or quarterly seasonality. 23 The monthly estimates of personal income, including compensation, are expressed at annual rates; consequently, the current quarterly estimates, also expressed at annual rates, may be derived by averaging the monthly estimates.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-12 In general, the release of the “third” current quarterly estimate of GDP marks the last opportunity to revise most NIPA estimates until the next annual update. However, because of the importance of the QCEW as a data source and because of the 5-month lag in its availability, an exception is made for private wages and salaries and for private employer contributions for government social insurance (for which the estimates are generally based on estimates of private wages and salaries). As part of the “second” current quarterly release of GDP, the preceding quarter’s estimates for these series and for affected income-side aggregates are revised in order to incorporate the newly available QCEW data.24 Thus, continuing with the example above, the end-of-November release of GDP for the third quarter (second estimate) also contains revised estimates of wages and salaries for the second quarter that are based on newly available QCEW data. The months of the second quarter are interpolated based on the QCEW-derived quarterly control. For federal and for state and local government employees, the current quarterly estimates are derived by summing monthly extrapolations from the most recent annual estimates. Federal civilian estimates for both general government and government enterprises are extrapolated using an indicator series that is based primarily on CES employment data. Federal military estimates are extrapolated using Department of Defense employment data. State and local government estimates for both general government and government enterprises are extrapolated using an indicator series that is based on CES employment data and on information on the change in the cost of labor from the BLS employment cost index. Supplements to wages and salaries Current quarterly estimates of employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds are released only for the aggregate, which is prepared as the sum of the components or aggregate levels of the components. In most cases, the component estimates are prepared by judgmentally projecting annual estimates into the next year and then interpolating those projected annual estimates into quarterly (and monthly) estimates. Current quarterly estimates of employer contributions for government social insurance funds are also prepared as the sum of its components. These components are generally extrapolated from the annual estimates to quarterly (and monthly) estimates using indicator series, so they are made available as part of the NIPA underlying detail (see the section “Recording in the NIPAs”). In most cases, the indicator series are based on NIPA wage and salary estimates or the component estimates are extrapolated without an indicator but with information from Budget projections of relevant outlays.

Affected aggregates include gross domestic income, the statistical discrepancy, gross national income, national income, personal income, disposable personal income, personal taxes, personal saving, gross (national) saving, compensation, and gross product of corporate business.

Adjustments are made to the QCEW data to account for wages and salaries that are underreported on employment tax returns, for tips that are underreported, and for wages and salaries that are not reported at all because the employers fail to file an employment tax return. • The estimates of underreported income are based on audits of individual employment tax returns undertaken as part of the IRS National Research Program (NRP) for the 2001, 2006, 2008-2010, 2011-2013, 2014-2016 and 2017-2019 (projected) as well as tax gap measures for various years from the previous IRS TCMP studies.25 • The adjustment for underreported tips or gratuities is derived in the preparation of BEA’s input-output accounts for industries—primarily accommodations, food services, taxis, barber shops, and beauty salons—where tips are a significant factor in compensation. The adjustment is based on the assumption that not all tips are included in the wages and salaries reported on the employment tax returns, and it is derived using information on industry sales and information on “tip rates” from the IRS. • The estimates of nonreported income are based on “exact-match” studies that the Census Bureau provides to BEA.

This entry accounts for all of the other adjustments that are made in the estimation of NIPA wages and salaries, including estimates for employees not covered by the QCEW and estimates for differences between the QCEW and the NIPA definitions of wages and salaries. Adjustments for employees not fully captured in the QCEW data are made as follows: • for federal government enterprises excluding the U.S. Postal Service (which is covered by the QCEW), based on Budget data. • for farms, based on data on farm labor expenses from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). • for farm labor contractors, primarily based on data for contract farm labor expenses from the Census of Agriculture. • for private elementary and secondary schools, primarily based on annual payroll data from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns; estimates of in-kind wages are judgmentally derived. • for religious membership organizations, primarily based on annual payroll data from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns; estimates of in-kind wages are judgmentally derived. • for private households, primarily based on CPS data; estimates of in-kind wages are judgmentally derived.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-16 • for railroads, primarily based on wage and salary data from the Railroad Retirement Board. Adjustments for differences between the QCEW and the NIPA definitions of wages and salaries include the following: • An adjustment to include compensation received from foreign employers and to exclude compensation paid to foreigners in order to make the measure consistent with national income, derived from ITA estimates of compensation received from foreigners. Alternatively, in gross domestic income tables, the ITA estimate of compensation paid to the rest of the world is included and the ITA estimate of compensation received from the rest of the world is excluded. The ITA estimates of compensation received from, and paid to, foreigners are based mostly on data from foreign statistical authorities and from the IRS, as well as various demographic and labor market data from the USDA and the Department of Labor.26 • An adjustment to include employer contributions to “cafeteria plans” that are excluded from the QCEW data for private industries and for state and local governments when state laws do not count them as wages for unemployment insurance purposes. These plans allow participating employees to use a portion of their salaries on a pre-tax basis to pay for health insurance and for “flexible spending accounts,” which reimburse employees for medical care and for dependent daycare. The adjustment is based on data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and on trade source data.27 This adjustment is not needed for federal employer contributions to these plans because they are included in the QCEW data for all states. Adjustment for timing for accrual basis (line 6). This adjustment accounts for differences in the timing of wage and salary disbursements from QCEW data and the accrual basis underlying the NIPA measure of wages and salaries. A positive adjustment reflects a net amount of compensation that was earned, but not actually received (and therefore not reflected in the source data) during the period, and a negative adjustment reflects a net amount of compensation that was paid (and reflected in the source data), but not actually earned, during the period. In practice, as reliable source data are generally lacking on these differences, timing adjustments are infrequent. 26 For more information on the sources and methods for estimating compensation paid to and received from the rest of the world, see the section “Compensation of Employees” in “U.S. International Transactions Accounts: Concepts and Estimation Methods,” at www.bea.gov. 27 For more information, see Clinton P. McCully and Steven Payson, “Preview of the 2009 Comprehensive Revision of the NIPAs,” Survey 89 (May 2009): 11.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-25 Appendix A: NIPA Measures of Employment and Hours BLS is the principal provider of information on the labor market in the United States, including detailed data on employment, hours, and earnings. BEA prepares its own measures of employment and hours—based primarily on BLS data—to provide estimates that are consistent with the NIPA measures of compensation. That is, the NIPA measures of compensation and of employment and hours cover the same employees, they are adjusted consistently for misreporting, coverage, and definitions, and they are based primarily on the BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) source data. Thus, the NIPA measures of employment and hours facilitate analyses of NIPA-based compensation and productivity by employee. The QCEW program serves as a near census of quarterly employment information by 6- digit NAICS industry. The data reflect the number of workers covered by the Unemployment Insurance (UI) or the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) programs and are derived from quarterly reports filed by almost every employer in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All filled positions are included, whether full or part-time, temporary, or permanent; as such it is likely that a multi-job holder will be counted two or more times in QCEW data. The estimates include foreign professional workers and undocumented migratory workers employed temporarily in the United States; these are classified as “Rest of world.” The NIPA measures of employment by industry from 2001 forward are classified according to the North American Industry Classification System; prior to 2001, the measures are classified according to the Standard Industrial Classification system. Recording in the NIPAs The NIPAs present current-dollar annual estimates of employment and hours by industry in the following tables: 6.4 Full-Time and Part-Time Employees by Industry 6.5 Full Time Equivalent Employees by Industry 6.6 Wages and Salaries per Full Time Equivalent Employee by Industry 6.7 Self-Employed Persons by Industry 6.8 Persons Engaged In Production by Industry 6.9 Hours Worked by Full-Time and Part-Time Employees by Industry Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods The NIPAs present the following annual employment estimates: Full- and part-time employees by industry.

The measure is adjusted as described in the section on “Adjustments to the QCEW employment data.” Full-time equivalent employees by industry. This measure equals the number of employees on full-time schedules plus the number of employees on part-time schedules converted to a full-time basis. For the current year, the number of nonfederal full-time equivalent employees in each industry is the product of the total number of employees, from the QCEW, and the ratio of average weekly hours per employee for all employees to average weekly hours per employee on full-time schedules, based on data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Census Bureau for BLS. For previous years, the number of full-time equivalent employees in each industry is the product of the total number of employees and the ratio of full time employees to total employees, also from the CPS. An industry’s full-time equivalent employment will be less than the number of its employees on full- and part-time schedules, unless it has no part-time employees. For federal employees and for the military, the number of full-time equivalent employees is based on data from the Budget of the United States Government.28 Wages and salaries per full-time equivalent employee by industry. This measure is derived as the NIPA wages and salaries by industry divided by the NIPA measure of full-time equivalent employees by industry. Self-employed persons by industry. This measure consists of active proprietors or partners who devote a majority of their working hours to their unincorporated businesses. Unpaid family workers are not included. The measure is from BLS data on self-employment by industry and is not adjusted by BEA. Persons engaged in production by industry. This measure equals the NIPA measure of full-time equivalent employees plus the number of self-employed persons in each industry. Hours worked by full- and part-time employees by industry. For employees excluding the military, this measure is derived as the product of total full- and part-time employees and the number of average weekly hours per employee for all employees, multiplied by 52 weeks, based on BLS data. For the military, this measure is derived as the product of the number of active duty military members and an assumed number of hours per year, plus the product of the number of reservists and an assumed number of hours per year. 28 For federal civilian employees, the data are from the Historical Tables of the budget, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 10-27 Adjustments to the QCEW employment data The QCEW employment data are largely consistent with the concepts and definitions underlying the NIPA estimates of employment and hours. However, as with the QCEW wage and salary data, BEA makes adjustments to make the data fully consistent with NIPA concepts, definitions, and coverage. First, BEA adjusts employment so that it remains consistent with the wages and salaries estimates adjusted for misreporting. Second, though the QCEW program provides partial information on agricultural industries and on employees in private households, BEA uses additional source data to estimate most or all of the employment for the same industries for which wages and salaries are adjusted: farms, farm labor contractors, private households, private elementary and secondary schools, religious membership organizations, railroads, military, and U.S. residents who are employed by international organizations and by foreign embassies and consulates in the United States. Adjustment for misreporting. An adjustment is made to the QCEW data on private sector employment for consistency with the misreporting adjustments made to wages and salaries. That is, employment is adjusted in accordance with the adjustment to wages and salaries so that the proportional relationship between them remains the same. Adjustment for employment that is not covered or not fully covered by UI and UCFE programs. An adjustment is made to add the employment of several industries that are not covered or that are not fully covered by the UI and UCFE programs. Following the entries in table 10.2, the adjustments are: Government. Military employment is measured as the number of military personnel assigned to active duty units plus the number of military reserve unit members. The estimate is based on data from the Budget. Additional government-related adjustments are made for the employment of students and their spouses by public colleges or universities, for elected officials and members of the judiciary, for intelligence agents, and for interns employed by publicly administered hospitals and by social service agencies. These adjustments, which comprise only a very small share of the total government adjustment, are based on corresponding adjustments underlying BEA’s estimates of state personal income.29 Other. Other adjustments include estimates for employees not fully covered by the QCEW, as follows: • for federal government enterprises based on supplemental Budget data. • for farms, based on quarterly data from USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service on farm labor. • for farm labor contractors, based on corresponding adjustments underlying BEA’s state personal income estimates based on USDA data on expenditures for farm contract labor. 29 For more information on BEA’s estimates of state personal income, see “State Personal Income and Employment” at www.bea.gov.",

The measure is an integral part of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts”). BEA’s measure of nonfarm proprietors’ income provides a comprehensive and consistent economic measure of the income earned by all U.S. unincorporated nonfarm businesses. The featured measure – nonfarm proprietors’ income with inventory valuation adjustment and capital consumption adjustment – is not directly affected by changes in tax laws, is adjusted for nonreported and misreported income, and excludes dividend income, capital gains and losses, and other financing flows and adjustments, such as deduction for “bad debt.” Thus, the measure is a particularly useful analytical indicator of the health of noncorporate businesses and provides both a complement and contrast to the NIPA measure of corporate profits. Nonfarm proprietors’ income is a component of private enterprise income and personal income in the summary NIPA tables. Definitions and Concepts Nonfarm proprietors’ income measures the income, before deducting income taxes, of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and other private nonfarm businesses that are organized for profit but that are not classified as corporations.

Partnerships include most associations of two or more of: individuals, corporations, noncorporate organizations that are organized for profit, or of other private businesses. Other private businesses are made up of tax-exempt cooperatives, including credit unions, mutual insurance companies, and rural utilities providing utility services and farm marketing and purchasing services. The NIPA measures of national income and gross domestic income and their components present the incomes that accrue to factors of production as a result of their contribution to production. For corporations, these incomes are separately reported in detailed financial accounts and in tax returns, and they are reflected in the NIPA measures of corporate profits, compensation of employees, and net interest (as well as taxes). Unincorporated businesses, on the other hand, are able to move assets freely between business and personal accounts with little, if any, reporting requirements, and tax liabilities are not separated between unincorporated businesses and their owners. In fact, the income of unincorporated businesses is generally reported on individual income tax returns; while compensation paid to employees is separately reported, the income of the business is not distinguished from the labor of the business owner and therefore reflects the incomes that accrue as a result of the owner’s own labor and entrepreneurship. Similarly, dividend and interest incomes are separately reported but do not distinguish between business and personal receipts. The measure of nonfarm proprietors’ income is therefore a critical measure for analyses of the shares of income, as it reflects factor incomes that are not separately captured by the other income measures. Reflecting the concepts of national economic accounting, nonfarm proprietors’ income in the NIPAs is defined as that arising from current production. This income is measured as receipts less expenses as defined in federal tax law, but with several important differences. Table 11.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, nonfarm proprietors’ income.1 1 The NIPA measures of proprietors’ income are closely related to the measures for “mixed income” in the System of National Accounts (SNA). However, the SNA definition of mixed income is broader than proprietors’ income and includes rental income of persons, noncorporate current transfer payments, and portions of net interest paid and consumption of fixed capital. At the same time, the SNA has a more narrow definition of the entities earning mixed income that excludes limited liability partnerships and any enterprises for which it is possible to separate all assets, including financial assets, into those that belong to the household and those that belong to the business.

Moulton, “The National Income and Product Accounts and the System of National Accounts 2008: Comparison and Research Plans,” Survey of Current Business 95 (June 2015), and Charles Ian Mead, Karin E.

Includes all U.S. nonfarm partnerships that are or would be required to file IRS Form 1065 (U.S. Partnership Return of Income). Includes all other U.S. unincorporated private businesses— tax-exempt cooperatives providing utility services and farm marketing and purchasing services. Receipts include taxable income from entities otherwise classified as nonprofits. Receipts exclude capital gains and dividends and monetary interest received by nonfinancial business. Receipts exclude rental income received by persons that are not primarily engaged in the real estate business. Expenses exclude deductions for bad debt, depletion, and capital losses. Expenses exclude expensing for, and include depreciation of, intellectual property products (including software) mining exploration, shafts, and wells, and rental clothing and videos. Inventory valuation adjustment Inventory withdrawals are valued at current cost. Capital consumption adjustment Depreciation is valued at current cost. BEA uses data collected on a tax-accounting basis as the primary source of information for nonfarm proprietors’ income. These data are based on well-specified, consistent accounting definitions that, in general, parallel NIPA concepts and definitions. In addition, tax-accounting tabulations are comprehensive, covering all unincorporated businesses. However, the data are not entirely suitable for implementing the NIPA concept of income from current production. Consequently, BEA’s procedure for estimating nonfarm proprietors’ income mainly consists of adjusting, incorporating, and supplementing these data.2 The featured measure of nonfarm proprietors’ income includes two additional adjustments—the inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) and the capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj)—made to ensure that the measure reflects income from current production. The IVA reflects the fact that as prices change, businesses that value inventory withdrawals at original acquisition (historical) costs may realize inventory profits or losses. In the NIPAs, these gains or losses that result from holding goods in inventory are not considered income from current production and thus are removed from business income. The IVA converts the tax-accounting value of inventory withdrawals, which is based on a mixture of historical and current costs, to a 2 See the section “Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods.”",

The CCAdj is a two- part adjustment that (1) converts valuations of depreciation that are based on a mixture of service lives and depreciation patterns specified in the tax code to valuations that are based on uniform service lives and empirically based depreciation patterns; and (2) like the IVA, converts the measures of depreciation to a current-cost basis by removing from profits the gain or loss that arises from valuing the depreciation of fixed assets at the prices of earlier periods. A reconciliation of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) measures of depreciation and BEA’s measures of consumption of fixed capital for corporations and for proprietors are provided in NIPA “Table 7.13 Relation of Consumption of Fixed Capital in the National Income and Product Accounts to Depreciation and Amortization as Published by the Internal Revenue Service.”4 The composition of proprietors’ income with IVA and CCAdj is illustrated below. 2017 estimate (billions of dollars) Nonfarm proprietors’ income with IVA and CCAdj 1,387.6 Nonfarm proprietors income without IVA and CCAdj 1,088.1 IVA -7.2 CCAdj 306.8 For consistent accounting at historical cost 350.0 For current-cost valuation -43.3 Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy.

Because total depreciation cannot exceed the amount of the investment, the amount of depreciation remaining to be taken in future years will be reduced. As depreciation will be increased during the “bonus” span and lowered thereafter, and because depreciation is an expense in calculating net income, NFPI will be understated during the “bonus” span and overstated thereafter. BEA’s featured measure of nonfarm proprietors’ income–that is, NFPI with IVA and CCAdj—are not affected by bonus depreciation because the CCAdj replaces tax-based depreciation with economic depreciation—that is, consumption of fixed capital (CFC). BEA’s estimates of bonus deprecation are published and are based on data from the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) of the U.S. Department of Treasury and on other source data. For more information, see OTA’s working paper “Corporate Response to Accelerated Tax Depreciation: Bonus Depreciation for Tax Years 2002–2004.”",

Taxes on proprietors’ income are included in personal current taxes, which appears in the Personal Income and Outlay Account (account 3) and in the Government Receipts and Expenditures Account (account 4). The NIPAs present current-dollar annual estimates of gross domestic income by type of income, national income by type of income, and national income by sector and legal form of organization. The sector-specific estimates follow the NIPA sectors—business (including government enterprises), households and institutions, general government, and the rest of the world; within the business sector, the estimates by legal form are classified according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filing requirements for corporate and noncorporate business. Noncorporate business is made up of proprietors—that is, sole proprietorships, partnerships, and “other private business.”5 Annual estimates of nonfarm proprietors’ income are also available by industry; the industry-specific estimates for 1998 forward are classified according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the three-digit industry level, and the estimates prior to 1998 are classified according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC); the estimates for 1998-2000 are also available on an SIC basis.6 Estimates of nonfarm proprietors’ income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments and its aggregate components are also available quarterly.

For instance, NIPA table 6.12D. Nonfarm Proprietors' Income by Industry, comprises four separate tables: table 6.12A, based on the 1942 SIC; table 6.12B, based on the 1972 SIC; table 6.12C, based on the 1987 SIC; and table 6.12D, based on the 2012 NAICS. For more information on the conversion from the SIC to NAICS, see John R. Kort, “The North American Industry Classification System in BEA’s Economic Accounts,” Survey 81 (May 2001): 7–13. 7 The NIPAs also present annual and quarterly estimates of proprietors’ income with IVA and CCADj in NIPA table group 2 as part of personal income. Annual and quarterly estimates of “proprietors’ income with IVA and CCAdj” and its major components are available in NIPA table 2.1. Personal Income and Its Disposition, and monthly estimates of the same series are available in NIPA table 2.6. Personal Income and Its Disposition, Monthly. Annual estimates of proprietors’ income with IVA and CCAdj are available for households in NIPA table 2.9.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also prepares measures of nonfarm proprietors’ income; specifically, estimates of the net profit (less loss) of nonfarm proprietorships and partnerships. The estimates are derived from tax returns as part of the Statistics of Income (SOI) program and form the basis of BEA’s nonfarm statistics; BEA presents the relationship between them in “Table 7.14 Relation of Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income in the National Income and Product Accounts to Corresponding Measures as Published by the Internal Revenue Service.” A reproduction of table 7.14 appears in the technical note at the end of this chapter, “Adjustments to IRS Source Data for Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income.” Additionally, as noted above, NIPA table 7.13 presents the relationship between IRS measures of depreciation and BEA measures of consumption of fixed capital for corporations and for nonfarm sole proprietors and partnerships. Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier in the handbook, most of the NIPA estimates are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods”). Table 11.A at the end of this chapter summarizes the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the most recent annual estimates and the current quarterly estimates of nonfarm proprietors’ income for the industry categories shown in NIPA table 6.12; the benchmark and other annual estimates for all industries are derived using the same source data and methods and are described below. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Annual estimates (except most recent year) Tabulations of income from individual income tax returns are prepared by the IRS and are published in the fall issues of the Statistics of Income Bulletin. The tabulations for sole proprietorships are based on a stratified random sample of individual tax returns, and the tabulations for partnerships are based on a stratified random sample of information returns; each provides universe totals by NAICS industry for many of the items on the returns, including receipt and expense items.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 11: NONFARM PROPRIETORS’ INCOME 11-7 The IRS tabulations become available about two years after the year to which they refer, and this timing determines the incorporation of these data into the NIPA estimates. For example, in the September 2023 annual update of the NIPAs, the IRS tabulations for 2021 were the primary source for the estimates for that year; the IRS provides the data prior to its fall publication so that it can be incorporated in the annual update of the NIPAs. The estimates for the most recent year, 2022, were obtained by extrapolating the 2021 estimates (see the section “Most-recent-year estimates”). The starting point for the NIPA estimates of income for nonfarm sole proprietorships (except for those proprietors that are primarily engaged in real estate) is the measure of “Net profit (less loss) of nonfarm proprietorships and partnerships, plus payments to partners, IRS” (line 1), based on the IRS measure of “net income less deficit.” “Guaranteed payments to partners” reflects the compensation of partners for the use of capital or services that are separate from the distribution of partnership income. For partnership income (except for those primarily engaged in real estate), the starting point is the IRS measure of “ordinary business income (loss); for the income of sole proprietorships or partnerships that are primarily engaged in real estate, the starting point is the IRS measure of “net rental real estate income (loss)” and “other net rental income (loss)” from Form 1065 schedule K.8 Adjustments to the IRS tax return data The by-industry IRS totals are adjusted by BEA as described below; a reconciliation of the IRS and the NIPA measures is presented annually in NIPA table 7.14, which is reproduced for the year 2017 below and discussed in detail in the technical note at the end of this chapter.

These adjustments are published annually in “Table 7.14. Relation of Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income in the National Income and Product Accounts to Corresponding Measures as Published by the Internal Revenue Service.” A reproduction of this table is shown below in table 11.3. Adjustments to IRS Source Data for Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income The starting point for the derivation of the estimates of nonfarm proprietors’ income is “Net profit (less loss) of nonfarm proprietorships and partnerships, plus payments to partners, IRS” shown on line 1 in table 11.3 below. This measure is based on the all-industry total of the IRS item “net income less deficit” obtained from the Statistics of Income Bulletin. (This item differs from the IRS measure of total business receipts less total business deductions by the amount of “passive” activity losses that are excluded from the IRS measure of total deductions but that are included in the IRS measure of deficit.) The adjustments to the IRS data are discussed below in the order shown in the table.",

Adjustment for misreporting on income tax returns (line 2). Adjustments are made to the SOI data to account for income that is underreported on employment tax returns and for income that is not reported at all because the individuals fail to file a tax return; together, these adjustments have accounted for approximately 50 percent of proprietors’ and partnership income in the NIPAs since the 1970s. There is an additional misreporting adjustment offset to remove wages that are incorrectly reported as income. This adjustment is part of the post-tabulation amendments and revisions on line 3. Underreported income. The estimates of underreported income are based on audits of individual employment tax returns undertaken as part of the IRS National Research Program (NRP) for 2001, 2006, 2008-2010, 2011-2013, 2014-2016 and 2017-2019 (projected) as well as tax gap measures for various years from the previous IRS TCMP studies. Estimates of the underreporting of the income of sole proprietors are taken directly from the IRS studies for the years covered by the studies. The underreporting of income by partnerships is not separately identified in the IRS reports but is combined with the underreported income of S corporations. The partnership share of this measure is derived from the partnership share of reported business",

The estimates of nonreported income are based on “exact-match” studies from the Census Bureau for various years before 2003 and each year from 2003 forward. These studies match records from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey with individual IRS tax returns and provide industry-level measures of the total self-employment nonfarm income for those persons with validated social security numbers that did not file tax returns.

This adjustment includes a number of items, including those described in table 11.4 below.13 12 The IRS Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP) had provided estimates of misreported income for selected years since 1963. In 2001, the IRS launched the NRP to update the research and to reflect a changing economy, revisions to the tax code, and shifts in individual behavior. 13 The post-tabulation amendments and revisions that are not described in table 11.4 are very small. They include an adjustment to include the capital gains or losses of real estate developers because their function is trade rather than holding assets for profits and therefore reflects income from production; the exclusion of Section 1231 adjustments – that is, the capital gains or losses on real property because they do not reflect income from current production; and the inclusion of the income earned by newspaper carriers that is excluded from the SOI data.",

The adjustment is based on SOI tabulations of depletion. Adjustment to depreciate expenditures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells (line 5). Expenditures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells are treated as capital formation in the NIPAs. In contrast, the IRS permits some of these expenditures to be charged as current expense. Therefore, the SOI measures of depreciation, by industry, are adjusted to remove the expensed portion of the current year’s investment and to add a charge for the depreciation of the investments made in the current and in previous years. The capital formation of drilling and oil well casing is estimated from the American Petroleum Institute’s Joint Association Survey on Drilling Costs and BLS producer price indexes (PPIs). For oil well casing, the quantity is valued using the PPI for casing. For drilling, the quantity is valued using data in the Joint Survey. Expenditures for exploration are obtained from the Annual Survey of Oil and Gas. Expenditures for mine shafts are extrapolated from Census data. The value of the capital formation is depreciated over average service lives of 20 years by geometric depreciation. Bad debt expense (line 6). Bad debt expenses are not considered to be expenses associated with current production and thus should not be reflected as expenses in calculating NIPA profits. The adjustment removes these expenses, based on the bad-debt expense item in the SOI tabulations. Income received by fiduciaries (line 7). Sole proprietors that act as fiduciaries (trustees, guardians, executors of trusts or estates) file IRS Form 1041 instead of Form 1040, and they are therefore excluded from SOI tabulations of proprietorships and partnerships. This adjustment adds their income, based on separately available SOI data for 1950, 1974, and 1985. For other years, gross profits, depreciation, and other deductions are extrapolated separately using corresponding items for nonfiduciary sole proprietorships as reported in the SOI tabulations. Income of tax-exempt cooperatives (line 8). This adjustment is the sum of separate adjustments for each type of “other” private business—specifically, rural electric cooperatives, rural telephone cooperatives, and farmers’ marketing cooperatives that are not included in the SOI tabulations because of their tax-exempt status. The adjustments for rural electric and telephone cooperatives are based on annual data from the USDA’s Rural Electrification Administration. The adjustment for farmers’ marketing cooperatives estimates the patronage dividends earned by these cooperatives based on sales data and profit margins data provided by USDA’s Farmer Cooperative Service.",

The featured measure of rental income of persons—rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment—is provided net of depreciation and the costs associated with providing property. As such, it can be viewed as a “profit- like” measure. In the summary NIPA tables, rental income of persons is a component of gross domestic income and of national income for the total economy, as well as measures of personal income and of private enterprise income. Definitions and Concepts Rental income of persons reflects the income that accrues from the provision of property (i.e., housing or other structures, equipment, intellectual property, or natural resources) owned by persons who are resident in the United States.1 As shown in the sample of NIPA table 7.9 below, separate measures of rental income are provided for legal forms of organizations—for “other private business” and for “households and nonprofit institutions.”2 The NIPAs classify persons that own property as either part of the household and NPISH sector or as part of the business sector. Specifically, individuals that rent property and are required to report rental and royalty income on the IRS individual income tax return, and tax-exempt cooperatives, are classified as part of “other private business,” a subsector of the NIPA business sector.3 Individuals that occupy the homes that they own are treated as unincorporated businesses and are classified in the household and institutions sector. Because both types of property owners 1 Persons resident in the United States are those who are physically located in the United States and who have resided, or expect to reside, in this country for 1 year or more. For more information on residence, see “Definitions and Concepts” in Chapter 8: Net Exports of Goods and Services. 2 For more information on legal forms, see Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts. 3 Rental and royalty income are reported on IRS Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, a section of the individual income tax return. “Other private business” also includes entities that are not required to file but would be so required if they met size or income criteria.",

As noted in “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts,” the NIPA production boundary for households is limited to the housing services provided by homeowners to themselves (“owner-occupied housing”) and the production of domestic services (e.g., market cleaning services). Thus, the rental income of households is limited to the services of owner-occupied housing. The provision of nonresidential properties, of rights to intellectual and natural resources, and of permanent-site housing services to tenants more closely resembles business activity; as such, it is recorded as production and income of other private business or of nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISH). Measures of nonmarket household production, such as housework and childcare, are excluded from the NIPAs.5 The incomes associated with the production by households of other market goods and services are recorded as proprietors’ income.6 Separate measures of rental income are provided by type of property and by type of occupant. Specifically, for other private business, separate measures are prepared for rental income from farm and nonfarm tenant-occupied permanent-site housing, from nonresidential properties (structures, equipment, and the real estate investments of private pension plans), and from the rights to intellectual property and natural resources (recorded as royalties). For households and NPISH, measures are prepared for rental income from nonfarm owner-occupied permanent-site dwellings, from mobile dwellings, from farm owner-occupied housing, and from tenant-occupied housing owned by NPISH. By convention, all rental income of persons from tenant-occupied permanent site housing is recorded as other private business or as NPISH, as noted above; also by convention, rental income from tenant-occupied mobile homes owned by persons is recorded as proprietors’ income. Table 12.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, rental income of persons. 4 The NIPAs also provide measures of the income and outlays of the households and institutions sector that exclude the income of “other private business,” and, as part of the 2003 comprehensive revision of the NIPAs, BEA began providing separate estimates of household and of NPISH income and outlays; see Charles Ian Mead, Clinton P. McCully, and Marshall B. Reinsdorf, “Income and Outlays of Households and of Nonprofit Institutions Serving Households,” Survey of Current Business volume 83 (April 2003): 13-17. Additionally, the NIPAs provide measures of saving and investment of households and institutions sector that exclude “other private business.” 5 BEA has prepared alternative measures of household output that include the value of nonmarket household production; see Benjamin Bridgman, “Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts,” Survey, volume 96 (February 2016): 1-5. 6 Before 2003, the services of owner-occupied housing were also classified as output of the business sector. As part of the 2003 comprehensive revision of the NIPAs, owner-occupied housing was reclassified to the households and institutions sector to reflect the fact that the housing in this case is produced by households for their own use and is not sold on the market.",

Neither is rental income of persons a comprehensive measure of the income generated by housing, as housing services are also provided by governments, by corporations, and by sole proprietorships and partnerships. Given the importance of housing to the health of the economy, the NIPAs also provide measures that reflect the production and income of an alternative “housing” sector, of which the households and institutions sector is only a part; these measures reflect the output associated with housing—and only housing— provided by all owners.7 Measures of final expenditures for housing services that are consistent with the output of the housing sector are reflected in BEA’s estimates of personal consumption expenditures. The inclusion in rental income of persons of income from tenant-occupied permanent-site housing, from nonresidential properties, and from rights to intellectual property or natural resources is straightforward; as explained in chapter 2, the income approach measures GDP—or gross domestic income (GDI)—as the sum of the income 7 Measures for the housing sector are discussed in Mayerhauser, Nicole and Marshall Reinsdorf, “Housing Services in the National Economic Accounts,” September 2007.",

The inclusion of income from owner-occupied housing (both permanent-site and mobile homes) in rental income of persons warrants further explanation. As noted in chapter 2, purchases of newly constructed housing are treated as private fixed investment rather than as consumption expenditures in the NIPAs, and the stock of housing is treated as fixed assets. The housing stock provides a flow of housing services that are consumed by persons who rent their housing and by persons who own the housing they occupy (referred to as “owner-occupiers”). In the NIPAs, owner-occupiers are treated as owning unincorporated enterprises that provide housing services to themselves in the form of the rental value of their dwellings.8 Thus, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for housing services includes both the monetary rents paid by tenants and an imputed rental value for owner-occupied dwellings (measured as the income the homeowner could have received if the house had been rented to a tenant), and rental income of persons includes the monetary income earned by landlords and an imputed rental income earned by owner-occupiers. This treatment is designed to make PCE, GDP, and the incomes associated with them invariant to whether the house is rented by a landlord to a tenant or is lived in by the homeowner. The imputation also increases the international comparability of the NIPAs because rates of home ownership differ significantly from country to country; by including both tenant-occupied and owner-occupied housing services in output and income measures, comparisons are not affected by these differences. It is also worth noting that as a component of income, depreciation—a cost incurred in production—is reflected in the measures of rental income, as shown in table 12.1 above. Much of the source data underlying BEA’s measures of depreciation are based on tax-accounting information, so the source data must be adjusted to reflect consistent economic-accounting measures that are valued at current-replacement cost. The capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj) is a two-part adjustment that (1) converts depreciation measures that are based on a mixture of service lives and depreciation patterns specified in the tax code to measures that are based on uniform service lives and empirically based depreciation patterns; and (2) converts the measures to a current-cost basis by removing from rental income the gain or loss that arises from valuing the depreciation of fixed assets using prices from earlier periods (i.e. prices at the time the asset was acquired).9 8This treatment is consistent with that of the international System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008): “Households that own the dwellings they occupy are formally treated as owners of unincorporated enterprises that produce housing services consumed by those same households.” Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008: 6.117. 9 For information on the derivation of the CCAdj, see Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, 1925–97, September 2003, available on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov.",

In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, “rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment” appears as an income component in the Private Enterprise Income Account (account 2) and in the Personal Income and Outlay Account (account 3). Additionally, it is a component of national income and, as a component of net operating surplus, it is reflected in gross domestic income (GDI) in the Domestic Income and Product Account (account 1). In the NIPAs, rental income of persons is shown by sector and by legal form of organization for other private business, for households, and for NPISH. The following is a list of the principal NIPA tables that present annual and, in some cases, quarterly, current-dollar estimates of rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment as a component of GDI and of national income.10 1.10 Gross Domestic Income by Type of Income (A) (Q) 1.11 Percentage Shares of Gross Domestic Income (A) 1.12 National Income by Type of Income (A) (Q) 1.13 National Income by Sector, Legal Form of Organization, and Type of Income (A) 1.16 Sources and Uses of Private Enterprise Income (A) 7.4.5 Housing Sector Output, Gross Housing Value Added, and Net Value Added (A) 7.9 Rental Income of Persons by Legal Form of Organization and by Type of Income (A) 7.12 Imputations in the National Income and Product Accounts (A) BEA also prepares nominal, or “current-dollar” estimates of rental income of persons that are not seasonally adjusted; these are available in Section 8 of the NIPA Interactive Data Tables. Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier, NIPA estimates, including those for rental income of persons, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (See “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods”). For rental income of persons, the estimates are based on statistical surveys and reports primarily from the Census Bureau, the Federal Reserve Board, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Office of Management and Budget, as well as from 10 The NIPAs also present annual and quarterly aggregate estimates of rental income of persons in NIPA table group 2 as a component of personal income.

The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Benchmark year estimates For all dwellings, rental income is equal to the rental value of the dwelling, as reflected in BEA’s measures of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for housing services, less the expenses associated with owning the property, plus any subsidies related to the property. Housing-related expenses are deducted because they are considered intermediate inputs to the production of rental services and as such, are already reflected in the rent charged for the service. In contrast, subsidies are added because it is assumed that owners reduce the rents they charge by the value of any property-related subsidies they receive. Measures of PCE for the services provided by tenant-occupied housing are based on data on rent paid by tenants and data on the number of tenant-occupied units, both from the American Community Survey’s (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS).12 For measures of PCE for the services provided by owner-occupied housing, estimates of rent per unit are derived using the rental equivalence approach, adjusted to include an “owner premium,” based on the same ACS data. The estimates of PCE for housing services are described in greater detail in “Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures.” Nonfarm tenant-occupied permanent site housing For nonfarm tenant-occupied permanent site housing, the ACS data on rental value as well as the data described below from other sources on expenses and subsidies cover all owners—that is, corporations, proprietors, NPISH, and individuals. Total rental income is split between the personal and business sectors based on data from the Census Bureau’s Census of Housing Residential Finance Survey (RFS) on the percentage of rental receipts that are received by businesses. The personal sector is then further split between individuals (classified as other private business) and NPISH based on RFS data on the percentage of permanent-site rental units that each subsector provides. Finally, business sector rental income is then split between corporations and 11 Black Knight Financial Services was formerly Lender Processing Services Applied Analytics. 12 BEA uses “1-year” ACS data; that is, data that are collected over 12 months of a calendar year. 1-year data are collected for areas with populations of 65,000 or more.

Data on expenses come from various sources, including BEA’s benchmark input- output accounts, the Census Bureau’s censuses of governments and of housing, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. BEA allocates each type of expense to tenant-occupied and to owner-occupied housing based on data from BEA’s benchmark input-output accounts, unpublished source data, or judgmental trends. For tenant-occupied housing, the current surplus of state and local housing enterprises and the following subsidies are added.13 Subsidies are added to either tenant- or owner-occupied housing based on the nature of the subsidy. For tenant-occupied housing, the following subsidies are added: • Section 8: This program provides rental assistance payments to landlords on behalf of low-income tenants. Estimates are provided by type of landlord (nonprofit, private, and state and local enterprises). • Section 236: Under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Rental Housing Assistance Program) the federal government subsidizes the monthly mortgage payment that a qualified owner of a rental or cooperative project is required to make. This subsidy reduces rents for lower income tenants • Rural housing service (RHS): Under the Rental Assistance Program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s RHS provides assistance to tenants through the Rural Rental Housing or Farm Labor Housing projects. • Other housing subsidies: Includes rental assistance and affordable housing programs provided by other public enterprises. Nonfarm owner-occupied permanent site housing For nonfarm owner-occupied permanent site housing, the PCE measure of the rental value is imputed using a stratified rental equivalent approach that regresses tenant rents, from which utilities have been excluded, on characteristics of tenant-occupied units reported in the ACS. Regression characteristics include structure type, number of rooms, 13 For state and local enterprises that provide housing, net operating income is comprised of federal subsidies and rental payments received by tenants, less expenses.

For owner-occupied housing, the following subsidies are added: • Section 235: The Housing and Urban Recovery Act of 1983 program subsidizes the interest payments of eligible homeowners for 10 years. • Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): FEMA provides disaster- related subsidy payments for temporary housing, repairs, mortgage and rental assistance, etc. • Road Home Grants: The Road Home program was a Federal grant to the states of Louisiana and Mississippi to aid persons displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The program, which provided subsidies for property repairs, operated from 2007 to 2018. Nonfarm owner- and tenant-occupied mobile homes For nonfarm owner- and tenant-occupied mobile homes, the PCE measure of the rental value is estimated in the same manner and using the same source data as measures of permanent site housing. The expenses deducted from this measure include “contract site rent”—the charge for the site upon which the home is located, where applicable—as well as mortgage interest paid, property taxes, consumption of fixed capital, and miscellaneous other costs (including property insurance and maintenance and repairs). Subsidies are not added in the measurement of rental income from mobile homes. As noted previously, only rental income from owner-occupied mobile units is attributed to households and NPISH; rental income from tenant-occupied mobile homes is instead recorded as proprietors’ income. Mobile home units include any non-permanent site dwelling identified in the ACS as a residence, including manufactured homes, houseboats, and recreational vehicles, etc. Farm owner- and tenant-occupied housing For owner- and tenant-occupied farm housing, the PCE measure of the rental value is estimated in the same manner and with the same source data as measures of nonfarm owner-occupied and tenant-occupied rental values. 14 According to the SNA, “The ratio of owner-occupied to rented dwellings can vary significantly…so both international and inter-temporal comparisons of the production and consumption of housing services could be distorted if no imputation were made for the value of own-account housing services.” (SNA 2008: 6.34).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 12: RENTAL INCOME OF PERSONS 12-10 Farm housing is classified in the ACS data as housing units with agricultural sales exceeding $1,000 per year. The rental value is adjusted to exclude expenses for maintenance and repairs, property taxes, mortgage interest, and property insurance. Estimates of these expenses are based on data from the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS). For tenant-occupied farm housing, the rental value is also adjusted for the capital consumption allowances of operator and non-operator landlords, based on IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) data. For owner-occupied housing, the rental value is adjusted to remove an estimate of consumption of fixed capital, based on data from BEA’s Fixed Assets Accounts. No subsidies are added to either owner- or tenant-occupied measures. The NIPAs do not record separate estimates of permanent site and mobile farm housing because source data on expenses are insufficient to support such a split. When a housing unit is identified in the ACS as a mobile unit and a farm unit, BEA allocates that unit as a farm unit. Tenant-occupied housing owned by NPISH For tenant-occupied housing owned by nonprofit institutions, the measure of the rental value is derived and allocated between individuals and NPISH as described above. Deducted expenses include property taxes, mortgage interest, depreciation, property insurance, maintenance and repairs, and administrative expenses; no subsidies are added. Nonfarm nonresidential properties For nonfarm nonresidential properties, rental income is estimated by multiplying BEA’s measures of the nonfarm nonresidential capital stock of structures and equipment owned by persons by an estimated rate of return on these assets. The rate of return on these assets is estimated by dividing the profits of corporate real estate operators and lessors of buildings, based on SOI data, by the value of their depreciable assets, also based on SOI data. The rental income of private employee pension funds imputed to persons is added to the total measure, based on data from the Federal Reserve Board. Royalty income For royalty income from intellectual property and from the rights to natural resources, rental income is equal to the net royalties received by individuals, by fiduciaries, and by nonprofit organizations less the expense of bonus payments for drilling rights for what are ultimately found to be “dry holes.” Data are primarily from the IRS SOI program. Nonbenchmark annual estimates Estimates for nonbenchmark years are generally prepared at the same level of detail as those for benchmark years.

For the most recent year, the estimate is judgmentally extrapolated from the benchmark values. Nonbenchmark annual estimates of expenses and subsidies are extrapolated based on various source data or by judgmental trend, as described in table 12.A. Current quarterly estimates The seasonally adjusted quarterly current-dollar estimates of the rental values reflected in PCE for all housing are prepared by reflating the estimates of real PCE for each type of dwelling using the CPI for rent of primary residence for tenant-occupied dwellings and the CPI for owners- equivalent rent of primary residence for owner- occupied dwellings.15 For expenses and subsidies, quarterly values are extrapolated based on various source data or by judgmental trend, as described in table 12A.For nonresidential structures and for royalty income, current quarterly estimates are primarily derived by judgmental trend. The not seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates of rental income of persons are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates, using the not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators. BEA has not found evidence of seasonality in housing services; consequently, the not seasonally adjusted estimates are equal to the seasonally adjusted estimates.16 15 As a component of the product-side measure of personal consumption expenditures, BEA prepares real (inflation-adjusted) measures of personal consumption expenditures for housing services; most income measures, including rental income of persons, are not adjusted for inflation. For more information on the derivation of inflation-adjusted measures, see “Price and Quantity Estimates in chapter 4 of this handbook. For more information on the derivation of real consumption expenditures for housing services, see “Quantity and price estimates” in chapter 5. 16 See NIPA table 8.2 Gross Domestic Income by Type of Income, Not Seasonally Adjusted.",

The estimates of corporate profits are an integral part of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), a set of accounts prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) that provides a logical and consistent framework for presenting statistics on U.S. economic activity (see “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts”). Corporate profits is one of the most closely watched U.S. economic indicators. Profitability provides a summary measure of corporate financial health and thus serves as an essential indicator of economic performance. Profits are a source of retained earnings, providing much of the funding for capital investments that raise productive capacity. The estimates of profits and of related measures may also be used to evaluate the effects on corporations of changes in policy or in economic conditions. Profits are also frequently used in measuring the rate of return on investment and the relationship between earnings and equity valuation. For example, the estimates of corporate profits before and after tax, along with estimates of corporate net value added, are used in preparing BEA’s annual measures of aggregate rates of returns for domestic nonfinancial corporations.1 BEA’s featured measure of corporate profits—profits from current production— provides a comprehensive and consistent economic measure of the income earned by all U.S. corporations. As such, it is unaffected by changes in tax laws, and it is adjusted for nonreported and misreported income. It excludes dividend income, capital gains and losses, and other financial flows and adjustments, such as deduction for “bad debt.” Thus, the NIPA measure of profits is a particularly useful analytical measure of the health of the corporate sector. For example, in contrast to other popular measures of corporate 1 See Sarah Osborne and Bonnie A. Retus, “Returns for Domestic Nonfinancial Business,” Survey of Current Business 98 (December 2018).",

In addition, BEA prepares associated measures of payments arising from corporate profits, including taxes and dividends. Taxes on corporate income consists of taxes on income paid to government and to the rest of the world. Corporate taxes are an important source of funding for federal and for state and local government operations. Net dividend payments consists of payments to shareholders by U.S. corporations. Corporate dividends paid to shareholders measures investment returns to them in the form of current income, including dividends paid to persons as a component of the NIPA measure of personal income. Definitions and Concepts Corporate profits measures the income, before deducting income taxes, of organizations treated as corporations in the NIPAs. These organizations consist of all entities required to file federal corporate tax returns, including mutual financial institutions and cooperatives subject to federal income tax; nonprofit organizations that primarily serve business; Federal Reserve banks; and federally sponsored credit agencies. Reflecting the concepts of national economic accounting, income in the NIPAs is defined as that arising from current production. This income is measured as receipts less expenses as defined in federal tax law, but with several important differences.2 Table 13.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, corporate profits. Table 13.1—Content of Corporate Profits Category of transaction Comments Corporate profits before tax Includes all U.S. corporations, including private corporations and S corporations. Includes other organizations that do not file federal corporate tax returns—such as certain mutual financial institutions and cooperatives, nonprofits that primarily serve business, Federal Reserve banks, and federally sponsored credit agencies. Receipts exclude gains, net of losses, from the sale of property. Receipts exclude dividends received. Expenses include distributions to shareholders of regulated investment companies that represent interest income, which are classified as interest payments in the NIPAs. 2 The NIPA measures of corporate profits are closely related to the measures for corporations in the System of National Accounts (SNA). However, the SNA definition has a broader definition of the corporate sector that includes most federal government and state and local government enterprises and private entities such as limited liability partnerships and nonprofit institutions that are primarily engaged in market production.

Inventory valuation adjustment Inventory withdrawals are valued at current cost. Capital consumption adjustment Depreciation is valued at current cost. Most businesses report profits on both a financial-accounting basis and a tax- accounting basis.3 Both financial accounting and tax accounting calculate profits as the difference between receipts and expenses; however, they differ in the definitions of some receipts and expenses, in the timing of when the receipts and expenses are recorded, and in the purposes for which the information is prepared. Financial-accounting measures, which reflect “generally accepted accounting principles,” underlie the reports to stockholders, to lenders, and to government regulatory agencies; tax-accounting measures underlie corporate income tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has tabulated an information return (the M-3) that reconciles various items (such as employee stock options) reported on financial reports with the same items reported on most corporate tax returns, beginning with 2005. The annual and quarterly financial reports prepared by individual companies provide the basis for another widely followed set of indicators of corporate profits—the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 measures of reported earnings, operating earnings, and earnings per share, which reflect the aggregate earnings of the 500 corporations that compose the S&P stock index.4 When available, BEA uses data collected on a tax-accounting basis as the primary source of information on corporate profits. These data are based on well-specified, consistent accounting definitions that, in general, more closely parallel NIPA concepts and definitions. For example, in financial accounting, corporations sometimes record the value of extraordinary losses before they actually incur the expenses associated with the losses. Financial accounting also allows some flexibility in the way definitions are applied by corporations—for example, in the selection of asset service lives and in the valuation of liabilities. In addition, tax-accounting tabulations are comprehensive, covering all incorporated businesses—both publicly traded and privately held—and all industries, while financial-accounting tabulations cover a subset of the corporate universe. However, financial-accounting information is more timely than tax-return data, so it is used by BEA to derive the estimates for the most recent year and for the current quarters. Neither set of accounting data is entirely suitable for implementing the NIPA concept of profits from current production. Consequently, BEA’s procedure for 3 For a general discussion of the NIPA accounting framework and of the underlying accounting principles, see the section “Accounting Framework,” in Chapter 2. For an in-depth discussion, see “An Introduction to National Economic Accounting,” Methodology Paper No. 1, September 2007 on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov. 4 The NIPA and S&P measures of profits differ significantly in purpose, coverage, source data, definitions, and methodologies; see Andrew W.

    "text": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-4 estimating NIPA corporate profits mainly consists of adjusting, incorporating, and supplementing these data.5 Profits from current production, the featured measure of corporate profits in the NIPAs, is derived as the sum of profits before tax (PBT) and of two adjustments—the inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) and the capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj). PBT—sometimes referred to as “book profits”—reflects corporate income regardless of any redistribution of income made through taxes. The PBT estimates are primarily based on tax-return information provided by the IRS in Statistics of Income: Corporation Income Tax Returns, which is then adjusted to conform to BEA coverage and definitions.6 PBT is distributed to government as taxes on corporate income and to shareholders as dividends or is retained as undistributed profits. The estimates of PBT are prior to the IVA and CCAdj (which are discussed in the following two paragraphs), so PBT reflects the charges used in business tax accounting for inventory withdrawals and for depreciation. As prices change, businesses that value inventory withdrawals at original acquisition (historical) costs may realize inventory profits or losses. In the NIPAs, these gains or losses that result from holding goods in inventory are not considered income from current production and thus are removed from business income. The IVA converts the business-accounting valuation of withdrawals from inventory, which is based on a mixture of historical and current costs, to a current-cost basis by removing the capital- gain-like or the capital-loss-like element that results from valuing these withdrawals at prices of earlier periods.7 Depreciation measured on a business-accounting basis must be adjusted to reflect consistent economic-accounting measures that are valued at current-replacement cost. The CCAdj is a two-part adjustment that (1) converts valuations of depreciation that are based on a mixture of service lives and depreciation patterns specified in the tax code to valuations that are based on uniform service lives and empirically based depreciation patterns; and (2) like the IVA, converts the measures of depreciation to a current-cost basis by removing from profits the capital-gain-like or capital-loss-like element that arises from valuing the depreciation of fixed assets at the prices of earlier periods.8 5 See the section “Overview of Source Data and Estimating Procedures.” In addition, for an in-depth discussion of estimation issues regarding corporate profits, see Dylan G. Rassier, “The Role of Profits and Income in the National Accounts,” Survey 91 (February 2012): 8–22. 6 For more information, see “Business Tax Statistics, Corporations,” at www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats- corporation-tax-statistics. 7 For more information, see “Chapter 7: Change in Private Inventories,” 7–4. 8 After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the subsequent perceived weakness in the economy, legislation was passed to stimulate business investment by temporarily modifying tax-based depreciation rules. As part of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, businesses were permitted to depreciate a “bonus” amount during the first year, over and above that allowed under traditional tax accounting rules. Because total depreciation cannot exceed the amount of the investment, the amount of depreciation remaining to be taken in future years was reduced. Hence, depreciation was raised during the “bonus” span and lowered thereafter, and because depreciation is an",

The profits component of domestic income excludes the income earned abroad by U.S. corporations and includes the income earned in the United States by foreign-owned corporations. These relationships are illustrated below. expense in calculating profits, PBT was understated during the “bonus” span and overstated thereafter. A number of subsequent economic stimulus acts also included provisions for “bonus” depreciation; therefore, the effects of tax acts of later years are net of offsetting bonus depreciation that was claimed in previous years. Profits from current production (PBT with IVA and CCAdj) was not affected by the acts, because it does not depend on the depreciation-accounting practices used for federal income tax purposes; instead, this measure of profits is based on an estimate of the value of fixed capital actually used up in the production process. However, because the acts reduced tax liability, profits from current production on an after-tax basis was adjusted by the net effect of the tax acts. Because the acts affect tax depreciation, the CCAdj was also adjusted by the same amount. BEA estimates of the adjustment are based on data from the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and on other source data (for more information, see OTA’s working paper “Corporate Response To Accelerated Tax Depreciation: Bonus Depreciation For Tax Years 2002-2004”). 9 For a general discussion of domestic and national measures in the NIPAs, see the section “Geographic coverage” in Chapter 2. 2017 estimate (billions of dollars) Corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj 2,225.2 Less: Rest of the world 498.9 Receipts from the rest of the world 804.1 Less: Payments to the rest of the world 305.2 Corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj, domestic industries 1,726.3",

These earnings include capital gains and other income excluded from PBT. The taxes are measured on an accrual basis, net of applicable tax credits. Profits after tax with IVA and CCAdj is equal to corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj less taxes on corporate income. It provides an after-tax measure of profits from current production. Net dividends consists of payments in cash or other assets, excluding the corporation's own stock, made by corporations located in the United States and abroad to stockholders who are U.S. residents. The payments are netted against dividends received by U.S. corporations, thereby providing a measure of the dividends paid by U.S. corporations to other sectors. Undistributed corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj is equal to corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj less taxes on corporate income and less net dividends. It measures corporate saving from profits. Net cash flow with IVA is equal to undistributed corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj plus consumption of corporate fixed capital less capital transfers paid (net). It is a profits-related measure of internal funds available for investment. Consumption of fixed capital (CFC) is the economic charge for the use of fixed capital. It is defined as the decline in the value of the stock of assets due to wear and tear, obsolescence, aging, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event.10 Capital transfers paid (net) is the net measure of unrequited transfers associated with the acquisition or disposal of assets between the corporate sector and other sectors. Corporate profits with IVA is defined in the same way as corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj, except corporate profits with IVA reflects the depreciation-accounting practices used for federal income tax returns. Profits by industry is shown on this basis because estimates of the CCAdj by industry are not available. 10 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of major disasters (those in which either the associated property losses or the insurance payouts exceed 0.1 percent of GDP) that records them as “changes in the volume of assets” rather than as CFC; see Eugene P.

It consists of net dividends and undistributed corporate profits. This measure is often used in comparisons with the S&P measures of reported earnings. Undistributed corporate profits without IVA and CCAdj is equal to PBT less taxes on corporate income and less net dividends. It measures corporate saving from book profits. In addition, BEA prepares estimates of gross corporate value added (see NIPA table 1.14), which is defined as the total value of all goods and services produced by the corporate sector (gross output) less the value of those goods and services that are used up in production (total intermediate inputs). For a discussion of the derivation of gross corporate value added and of related measures, see the appendix to this chapter. Recording in the NIPAs As described in Chapter 2, the NIPAs can be viewed as aggregations of accounts belonging to individual transactors in the economy. In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj appears in the Private Enterprise Account (account 2), and undistributed corporate profits with IVA and CCAdj appears in the Domestic Capital Account (account 6). Taxes on corporate income appears in the Private Enterprise Account, the Government Receipts and Expenditures Account (account 4), and the Foreign Transactions Current Account (account 5). Corporate dividends appears in the Private Enterprise Income Account, the Personal Income and Outlay Account (account 3), the Government Receipts and Expenditures Account, and the Foreign Transactions Current Account. The NIPAs include a substantial number of tables that present aggregate and detailed current-dollar estimates of corporate profits. In most of the NIPA tables, the totals are shown on a national basis. In tables showing industry detail, profits on a national basis are shown as the total of profits for domestic industries and for the “rest-of- the-world” industry.

As discussed earlier in the chapter, corporate profits from current production is derived as the sum of PBT, IVA, and CCAdj. The primary source for the PBT estimates is tax return information provided by the IRS in Statistics of Income: Corporation Income Tax Returns (Corporation Returns); BEA makes a series of adjustments to these data to conform them to NIPA coverage and definitions. BEA then adjusts the PBT estimate with the IVA and the CCAdj in order to derive an estimate of income earned from current production that is consistent with NIPA concepts. This section describes the sources and methods used for estimating PBT and for estimating the distributions of PBT.11 Payments from PBT to government as taxes on corporate income and to shareholders in other sectors as dividends are estimated independently and are discussed below. Undistributed profits—that is, profits that are retained by corporations—are derived by subtracting taxes on corporate income and net dividends from PBT. Table 13.A at the end of the main text summarizes the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the annual estimates and the current quarterly estimates of corporate profits for the industry categories shown in NIPA table 6.16. The source data and methods for the current quarterly estimates reflect both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted estimates unless otherwise noted. Annual (except most-recent-year) estimates For all but the most recent year, the annual estimates of PBT, taxes on corporate income, and net dividends for domestic industries are based primarily on annual tabulations of corporate income tax returns. The annual estimates of PBT and of net dividends for the rest of the world are from BEA's international transactions accounts (ITAs).12 The tabulations of corporate income tax returns are prepared by the IRS and published in Statistics of Income: Corporation Income Tax Returns. The tabulations are based on a stratified sample of unaudited tax returns that currently includes all active corporations with more than $50 million of assets (with certain exceptions) and smaller firms on a probability basis. The information on the returns is edited by the IRS in the course of preparing the tabulations. The tabulations provide the basis for estimates for the 11 For information on the derivation of the estimates of the IVA and the CCAdj, see “Chapter 7: Change in Private Inventories,” and see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods in the United States, 1925–97, September 2003. 12 For a detailed description of the ITA’s, see “U.S. International Transactions Accounts: Concepts and Methods” (June 2014) on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov.",

The IRS totals are the starting point for preparing the NIPA estimates. The preliminary and final IRS tabulations become available about 2 years and 3 years, respectively, after the year to which they refer, and this timing determines the incorporation of these data into the NIPA estimates. For example, in the September 2023 annual update of the NIPAs, the final IRS tabulations for 2020 became the primary source for the estimates of corporate profits for 2020 (replacing the preliminary tabulations as the source), and the preliminary IRS tabulations for 2021 became the primary source for the profits estimates for 2021. The estimates for the most recent year, 2022, were obtained by extrapolating the 2021 estimates (see the section “Most-recent- year estimates”). The adjustments that BEA makes to the IRS tabulations are summarized in the following section, and they are described in detail in the technical note to this chapter. Adjustments to the IRS tax return data As discussed, the IRS corporate tax return data are the primary source for BEA’s estimates of corporate profits. A reconciliation of the IRS and the NIPA measures is presented annually in NIPA table 7.16, which is reproduced for the year 2017 in table 13.3 below.",

This net number accounts for dividend payments made to persons and to government (also shown on line 18 of NIPA table 7.10, which shows a breakdown of dividends paid and received by sector). Dividends payments made to government (federal plus state and local governments on line 13 of table 7.10) are subtracted from total net corporate dividend payments to arrive at personal dividend income (line 21 of table 7.10).14 Most-recent-year estimates Profits before tax For PBT, the estimates for the most recent year are prepared by extrapolating the estimates for the preceding year (for a general description of the extrapolation method, see “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in chapter 4). The extrapolations are carried out separately for each of about 75 industries using indicators that are based on a variety of source data. Two of the principal sources are the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Financial Report and BEA tabulations of samples of shareholder reports. The Quarterly Financial Report is the source for the indicators for the following industries: mining; manufacturing; wholesale trade; retail trade; information; and professional, scientific, and technical services, except legal services. The indicators are based on tabulations of corporate income statements collected and published quarterly by the Census Bureau. They are derived by taking the Quarterly Financial Report measure “income (loss) before taxes” and subtracting the following items where possible: (1) dividend income, (2) nonrecurring items, including gain (loss) on sale of assets, restructuring costs, and asset write-downs, and (3) net income (loss) of foreign branches and equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries, net of foreign taxes. Aggregated shareholder reports are the source for the indicators for all of the components of the following industries: construction; administrative and waste management services; educational services; health care and social assistance; arts, 14 For more information on the derivation of dividend payments received by state and local governments, see the NIPA methodology paper MP-5 “Government Transactions” (September 2005) on BEA’s website at www.bea.gov.",

In addition, they are the source for the indicators for most of the components of the following industries: utilities; transportation and warehousing; finance and insurance; and real estate and rental and leasing. The indicators are based on income from samples of shareholder reports, including data drawn from S&P’s Compustat database for all public U.S. corporations that have reported data for the current and the prior year. For each industry, the indicator used is “pre-tax income” less “special charges” (unusual or nonrecurring items reported by the company before the deduction of taxes). In addition to the removal of special charges, BEA judgmentally removes certain other non-operating charges, such as unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses, asset write-downs, and other valuation gains or losses. For some financial industries, the indicators are based on information from reports filed with various government regulatory agencies, such as Call Reports with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, and from the annual reports of the various financial institutions. The indicators for the few remaining domestic industries are based on judgmental trends. For the rest-of-the-world industry, the estimates are from the ITAs. (For more information, see table 13.A.) Taxes on corporate income For the two tax series for which the annual estimates are not based on IRS tabulations of corporate income tax returns—nonresident taxes and state and local taxes on corporate income—the estimates for the most recent year are prepared using the same methods as those used for the preceding year (see the technical note to this chapter, table 13.8, lines 24–26). For federal taxes, the estimates of the carryback refunds adjustment for the most recent year are prepared using the same methods as those for the preceding annual estimates, while the audit tax adjustment is a judgmental estimate (see the technical note, table 13.8, line 23). For federal taxes (net of tax credits), the estimates for each industry are prepared by extrapolation, using indicators that are based on the same sources as those used for the PBT estimates. The industry estimates are summed and then forced to match a control total by absorbing proportionate shares of the difference. The control total is primarily based on data on tax collections from the Monthly Treasury Statement, separated by liability year using information from the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis. Net dividends Estimates for the most recent year are extrapolated, using indicators that are based on the same sources as those used for the PBT estimates. For dividends received by U.S. corporations from abroad, the IRS-based estimates are extrapolated using dividends paid by foreign corporations from the ITAs. For regulated investment companies, the estimates are extrapolated based on data from the Investment Company Institute. For real estate investment trusts, the estimates are extrapolated based on industry source data. For",

As with the preceding annual estimates, total net corporate dividends less dividend payments made to government yields personal dividend income. Current quarterly estimates The seasonally adjusted current quarterly estimates of PBT are derived by extrapolating the most-recent-year estimates (for an explanation of this method, see “Interpolation and extrapolation using an indicator series” in Chapter 4). The industry indicators used for the quarterly extrapolations are generally based on the same (seasonally adjusted) source data as those used for the most-recent-year estimates (see table 13.A). Not seasonally adjusted estimates of PBT are derived using the same methods as the seasonally adjusted estimates, using not seasonally adjusted versions of the same indicators. For nonresident taxes, the current quarterly estimates are prepared using the same methods as those used for the annual estimates. Seasonally adjusted (SA) estimates of other federal taxes are estimated by industry by dividing the SA PBT estimates by the implicit quarterly tax rate from the most recent year and judgmentally adjusting for outliers. This technique is based on the assumption that tax laws have not changed much from the previous year; if tax laws change appreciably, further judgmental adjustments are made. For state and local taxes, the estimates are based on tax collections data and on a timing factor that, in turn, is a function of the quarter-to-quarter change in NIPA profits before tax and the average tax rate.15 Not seasonally adjusted (NSA) tax rates are calculated in the same manner as SA tax rates; the SA PBT estimates are divided by the implicit quarterly tax rate from the most recent year and judgmentally adjusting for outliers. Quarterly estimates of gross flows of domestic corporate dividends paid and received are not prepared. Therefore, the current quarterly estimate of net national dividends is derived as a residual in the calculation of the current quarterly personal dividends. For the first, second, and third quarters of the calendar year, preliminary quarterly estimates of PBT, taxes on corporate income, and net dividends are released approximately 55 days after the end of the quarter (along with the “second” estimates of GDP), and revised quarterly estimates are released approximately 85 days after the end of the quarter (along with the “third” estimates of GDP). In general, the preliminary quarterly estimates are based on less complete information than the revised estimates. For 15 See Eugene P. Seskin and Alyssa E. Holdren, “Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 92 (August 2012): 25.",

For the fourth quarter of the year, preliminary estimates are not prepared, and the only current estimates for that quarter are released approximately 85 days after the end of the quarter. This delay occurs because the fiscal year for most corporations ends in the fourth quarter, and additional time is needed to complete the more comprehensive end-of-year reports. As part of the calculation of dividends received by persons, an estimate of net national dividends paid by corporations becomes available on the same schedule as the estimates of GDP, approximately 25 days, 55 days, and 85 days after the end of the quarter. In a reversal of the accounting identities used for preparing the annual estimates of dividends, personal dividends received are estimated first. Monthly estimates of SA personal dividends are prepared using as an indicator the seasonally adjusted dividends paid based on a Compustat sample. The monthly estimates are averaged to derive quarterly estimates of personal dividends received, which are then added to dividends received by government to derive net national dividends. Rest-of-the-world dividends (net) are subtracted to derive net domestic dividends, which are then split into financial and nonfinancial sectors using data from the Compustat sample.

Thus, for the misreporting adjustment, the most recent audit data is used to derive an adjustment for the preceding tax year. For example, in the 2023 comprehensive update of the NIPAs, 2021 was the most recent tax year, and 2020 was the year for which the available audit data were used to prepare the misreporting adjustment. For subsequent years, the adjustment was judgmentally extrapolated. The IRS audit consists of three steps. First, the IRS audits a small sampling of corporations and recommends how much, if any, additional tax liability is owed. Next, the corporations can appeal those recommendations. Finally, a resolution between the corporation and the IRS is reached, and the corporation pays the IRS. The methodology for the misreporting adjustment is to capture only the amount of tax actually collected (see the section “Taxes on Corporate Income”), raise it to a universe total, and then convert it from a tax-liability measure to a profits measure. The IRS publishes data on the recommended additional tax liability owed, stratified by asset size, but the amount actually collected is provided only for the total. Therefore, a ratio of additional collected tax to recommended additional tax is developed and applied to the recommended amounts on an asset-by-size basis to derive a universal total for additional tax liability. Finally, this tax-liability estimate is converted to a profits estimate using the statutory tax rate. The above methodology applies to corporations that are paying taxes on positive net income. For companies that report deficits and pay no taxes, the percentage of corporate deficits reported by IRS (based on historical research) is added to the above estimate of profits misreporting to arrive at the corporate misreporting adjustment.

    "text": "CHAPTER 13: CORPORATE PROFITS 13-27 The earnings of credit unions are treated as PBT in the NIPAs; however, they are not reflected in Corporation Income Tax Returns, because income of these institutions is not taxed. The adjustment consists of net income less dividends to shareholders and interest refunds as tabulated by the National Credit Union Administration for state- chartered and federally chartered credit unions. Depletion on domestic minerals (line 8). Natural resource discoveries are not considered to be capital formation in the NIPAs; consequently, depletion—the charge for the using up of these resources—is not a charge against current production. In contrast, the IRS permits depletion to be charged as an expense. Through this adjustment, the Corporation Income Tax Returns expense “depletion” is reduced by the domestic depletion claimed on tax returns, thereby increasing profits. The adjustment is calculated as the difference between depletion from Corporation Income Tax Returns and an estimate of foreign depletion based on special IRS studies. (The effect of foreign depletion is removed in line 17.) Adjustment to depreciate expenditures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells (line 9). Expenditures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells are treated as capital formation in the NIPAs. In contrast, the IRS permits some of these expenditures to be charged as current expense. Therefore, “other deductions” in Corporation Income Tax Returns are adjusted to remove the expensed portion of the current year’s investment and to add depreciation charges on investment made in the current and in previous years. Estimates of oil and natural gas drilling expenses are obtained from data on drilling footage and on prices from the American Petroleum Institute’s Joint Association Survey on Drilling Costs, BLS producer price indexes (PPIs), and until 1995, the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Oil and Gas. Beginning with 2006, prices are based on the Census Bureau’s Annual Capital Expenditures Survey and on PPIs. Estimates of expenses for the construction of mine shafts (for minerals other than petroleum and natural gas) are based on the quinquennial economic census and on capital expenditures from the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey. Depreciation charges for investment in mining exploration, shafts, and wells are estimated using a perpetual inventory calculation in which the investment is depreciated over time. The adjustment is prepared as an aggregate for all business and is allocated by legal form of organization and by industry, based on IRS tax-return data. State and local taxes on corporate income (line 10). PBT is measured before deduction of income taxes. Because state and local income taxes are expense items on the federal tax return, they must be added to Corporation Income Tax Returns “total receipts less deductions.” The estimate of taxes is based on state and local government receipts compiled by the Census Bureau in Quarterly Summary of State and Local Tax Revenue. The industry distribution of these taxes is based on data from Corporation Income Tax Returns for federal income tax liability.",

Expenditures for intellectual property products are treated as capital formation in the NIPAs.16 In contrast, the IRS permits some of these expenditures to be charged as current expense.17 Therefore, “other deductions” in Corporation Income Tax Returns are adjusted to remove the expensed portion of the current year’s investment and to add depreciation charges on investment made in the current and in previous years.

For more information on the sources and methods for intellectual property products, see the technical note at the end of “Chapter 6: Private Fixed Investment.” Disaster adjustments (net) (line 14). In the NIPAs, the loss of capital as a result of a catastrophic disaster and the insurance payouts that result from them do not affect income associated with current production. The adjustment consists of (1) the net of the value of losses recorded as depreciation (a current business expense) and (2) the insurance payouts made by insurance companies as a charge against profits less the income received by the claim holders.18 Depreciation estimates are based on data on insured damages at current cost, broken down by type, from the Insurance Service Office. The amount is adjusted for uninsured damages, distributed by industry according to regional impact using data from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns, and converted to historic-cost depreciation using various service lives and price indexes. In contrast, the IRS allows all uninsured disaster losses to be charged as current business expenses in “other deductions” on Form 4684. Insurance payouts and receipts are also based on data from the Insurance Service Office, supplemented by government insurance fund transactions. Income receipts are distributed by industry using the above information on historic-cost depreciation. Gains, net of losses, from sale of property (line15). Gains (net of losses) from sales of fixed assets and securities are not considered to be income from current production. Corporation Income Tax Returns total receipts less total deductions are adjusted to remove these gains and losses. The adjustment consists of the following items from Corporation Income Tax Returns: (1) the excess of net short-term capital gain over net long-term capital loss, from Schedule D, (2) the excess of net long-term capital gain over short-term capital loss (except for regulated investment companies), from schedule D, and (3) the net gain or loss from Form 4797 with two modifications for cases in which the gain or loss reflects current production. The first modification relates to income from the sale of timber, coal, iron ore, livestock, and unharvested crops. This income is treated as a gain or a loss for tax purposes but should be included in NIPA profits because it reflects current production. Therefore, an estimate of such gains or losses, based on data from Corporation Income 18 In the 2009 comprehensive update, BEA introduced a new treatment of major disasters (those in which either the associated property losses or the insurance payouts exceed 0.1 percent of GDP) that records them as “changes in the volume of assets” rather than as consumption of fixed capital; see Eugene P.

The second modification relates to “normal” accidental damage to fixed business capital.19 In Corporation Income Tax Returns, the net gains items include the excess of insurance payments for accidental damage over the historical-cost book value of the damaged property. In the NIPAs, this amount is not considered a capital gain: the insurance payment is an expense of current production for insurance carriers, and the historical cost of the damaged property is treated as depreciation. Thus, the Corporation Income Tax Returns net gains items are modified to exclude the amount of excess, which is estimated as the difference between the insurance payments, based on data on insurance losses from Best’s Aggregates and Averages: Property-Casualty, and BEA estimates of normal accidental damage to fixed capital other than repairable damage (see NIPA table 7.13, line 5). Dividends received from domestic corporations (line 16). These dividends are not part of corporate income from current production. However, receipts by corporations of dividends paid to them by other domestic corporations are included in total receipts less deductions in Corporation Income Tax Returns. This adjustment, based on information from Corporation Income Tax Returns, removes these dividends. Income on equities in foreign corporations and branches (to U.S. corporations) (line 17). This adjustment places total receipts less total deductions from Corporation Income Tax Returns on a domestic basis by removing the income earned abroad by U.S. corporations that is included in this total. The adjustment is estimated as the sum of (1) dividends received from abroad, from Corporation Income Tax Returns; (2) other foreign-source income reported in support of claims for foreign tax credits, from special IRS tabulations of Form 1118; and (3) income earned by U.S. corporations from operations in U.S. commonwealths and territories, from special IRS tabulations. Costs of trading or issuing corporate securities (line 18). The costs of trading and issuing corporate securities are treated as expenses of the current period in calculating NIPA profits. In contrast, in tax accounting, these costs are usually deferred, so an adjustment is needed. This adjustment can be divided into two parts: commissions (both explicit and implicit) and flotation costs (the costs of issuing debt or equity securities). The securities trading costs adjustment converts tax data, which treat expenses for brokers’ commissions as a reduction in future capital gains income, to a current-period expense for the purchase of brokers’ services. Most corporate capital gains are excluded by subtracting net gains reported on IRS tax forms using IRS source data associated with Schedule D of IRS Form 1120. However, this adjustment does not account for the capital gains on own-account trading of securities brokers and dealers, which reflect the imputed financial service charge paid by corporations to domestic securities dealers who do not 19 The NIPA treatment of the loss of capital as a result of a catastrophic disaster was covered in the above discussion of line 14.",

The securities trading costs adjustment treats commissions to brokers, commercial banks, and savings institutions from securities trading as an expense in the current period rather than as a reduction in future capital gains income. This adjustment applies to both explicit commissions and commissions indirectly charged through markups or “spreads” between the cost of acquiring a security and its sales price. The estimates of trading costs are based on product-line data on gains from brokering and dealing equities, debt securities, and derivatives from the Census Bureau’s 2012 Economic Census. These data are used to estimate total indirect commissions received, which are treated as expenses of the corporations purchasing securities from broker-dealers, and are allocated by type of buyer using Federal Reserve Board flow of funds data on securities holdings. Estimates of direct commissions are derived similarly. For commercial banks and for savings institutions, capital gains are estimated as the sum of trading account gains and fees and of securities gains from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data, less indirect commissions. For security brokers and dealers, estimates of capital gains through 2006 are based on data on gains from dealing and trading accounts from the Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey, less indirect commissions; thereafter, they are extrapolated based on company financial reports.20 For flotation costs, the adjustment is made to treat them as an expense in the current period rather than as amortized costs. The estimate is based on tabulations of new offerings of corporate securities and of associated expenses by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The allocation by industry is based on the SEC tabulations and on data on holdings of long-term mortgages and capital stocks from Corporation Income Tax Returns. Excess of employer expenses over actual employer contributions for defined benefit employee pension plans (line19). Corporate income tax return data on employer expenses for defined benefit plans are adjusted to reflect the difference between cash-based and accrual-based compensation and the interest costs of any underfunded or overfunded actuarial liabilities.21 The adjustment is based on data from the Employee Benefit Security Administration, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, the Social Security Administration, and the American Council of Life Insurance. Income received from equities in foreign corporations and branches by all U.S. residents, net of corresponding payments (line 20).

The audit adjustment is unique among tax adjustments in that the source data are not available to adjust the preliminary IRS tabulations; for that estimate, the adjustment is made judgmentally. In the NIPAs, tax refunds resulting from net operating losses are viewed as reducing tax liability in the year of the loss. IRS permits corporations with such losses to carry the loss back to claim a refund for taxes paid in preceding years and to carry forward the amount of the loss to offset profits in future years. BEA obtains data on carryback refunds from IRS tabulations of applications for carryback refunds. The adjustment is allocated by industry on the basis of deficits reported in Corporation Income Tax Returns. No adjustment is required for carry-forward losses, because the lower tax payments are reflected in Corporation Income Tax Returns. As indicated in table 13.5, several of the posttabulation adjustments to profits also have a tax impact. State and local taxes on corporate income (line 24). In the NIPAs, taxes on corporate income includes federal, state, and local taxes. Because state and local taxes are an expense item on the federal tax return, they must be added to the Corporation Income Tax Returns item, which includes only federal taxes. The estimate of taxes is based on state and local government receipts compiled by the Census Bureau in Quarterly Summary of State and Local Tax Revenue. The industry distribution of these taxes is based on data from Corporation Income Tax Returns for federal income tax liability. The adjustment is the same as that for PBT (shown on line 10 in table 13.4). Taxes paid by domestic corporations to foreign governments on income earned abroad (line 25). This adjustment records the payment of nonresidential taxes on the exports of services and income. The estimates are based on the ITAs. The annual total is allocated to industries using the industry distribution of foreign tax credits, based on data from Corporation Income Tax Returns. Tax credits (lines 26–28). The NIPA measure of taxes on corporate income reflects actual tax liability; consequently, tax credits must be subtracted from the Corporation Income Tax Returns tax item, which is before allowance for tax credits. Data for the adjustments by industry are from Corporation Income Tax Returns. U.S. tax credits claimed for foreign taxes paid (line 26).

Federal Reserve banks, Federal Home Loan Banks, and the Farm Credit System are included in the corporate sector of the NIPAs. Because these institutions do not file tax returns, their income and expenses are not included in Corporation Income Tax Returns. Through this adjustment, the dividends paid by these institutions are included in NIPA dividends, based on information from their annual reports. In addition, Federal Reserve banks are required to turn over their profits (less operating expenses) to the U.S. Treasury. Consequently, these payments, treated as dividends in the NIPAs, must be added to the IRS dividends. Data for this adjustment are from the Federal Reserve Board. U.S. receipts of dividends from abroad, net of payments to abroad (line 34). The Corporation Income Tax Returns item “dividends received from foreign sources” includes only the dividends received by corporations. To arrive at dividends on a national accounts basis, their Corporation Income Tax Returns item is removed, and the ITA measure of dividends received by all U.S. residents is added. A corresponding adjustment is made to outflows. The foreign dividend measure used for this adjustment includes the distributed earnings of unincorporated affiliates of U.S. and foreign direct investors. Earnings remitted to foreign residents from their unincorporated U.S. affiliates (line 35). By this adjustment, the distributions of unincorporated U.S. affiliates to their foreign direct investors are included as dividends paid. Net dividend payments by domestic industries are increased by this adjustment, and the receipt of these distributions by the rest of the world is reflected in the adjustments made to outflows in line 35. The annual total is allocated to industries based on data on dividends received from domestic corporations in Corporation Income Tax Returns. Interest payments of regulated investment companies (line 36). Interest payments of regulated investment companies, primarily from money market funds, are included in the Corporation Income Tax Returns measure of cash distributions. This adjustment reclassifies such payments from dividends to interest. The adjustment is estimated as interest received less the interest share of total deductions, based on data for regulated investment companies from Corporation Income Tax Returns. Dividends received by U.S. corporations (line 37). As noted earlier in the discussion of adjustments to PBT, the items for dividends received by corporations in Corporation Income Tax Returns are subtracted (line 16 plus a portion of line 17 in table 13.4) because they are not part of current production. This adjustment is made to the dividends component in order to obtain the appropriate measure of undistributed profits (which is calculated as PBT less taxes and dividends). The resulting measure of net dividends paid equals the dividend receipts of persons, government, and foreigners. The adjustment consists of domestic and foreign dividends received from Corporation Income Tax Returns. Earnings of U.S. residents remitted by their unincorporated foreign affiliates (line 38).

NET INTEREST (December 2023) Definitions and Concepts Recording in the NIPAs Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods Annual estimates Current quarterly estimates Table 14A—Summary of Methodology for Net Interest Appendix: Miscellaneous Payments The NIPA measure of “net interest” for the domestic economy reflects the aggregate interest paid, less the aggregate interest received, by business and by the rest of the world; conversely, it reflects the net income earned by government and persons for providing certain financial resources to the production process. As the measure includes only the interest that is charged for the provision of financial resources used in, or associated with, production, it is a useful indicator of the return to that type of financial investment. Interest is a type of property income; specifically, interest is a measure of the income “receivable by the owners of certain kinds of financial assets, namely: deposits, debt securities, loans and (possibly) other accounts receivable for putting the financial asset at the disposal of another institutional unit.”1 As such, interest income is not directly generated in the production process, and it is therefore excluded from the NIPA measure of gross domestic income.2 However, net receipts of interest (that is, receipts less payments) are included in the NIPA measures of corporate profits and of proprietors’ income, both of which are components of gross domestic income. To offset these receipts, the NIPAs include net interest payments (payments less receipts) as a component of gross domestic income to ensure that this measure appropriately reflects only those incomes that are directly generated in production.3 In the NIPA measures of gross domestic income and of national income, net interest is consolidated with “miscellaneous payments”—a measure of the rent and royalty payments that accrue to owners of land or subsoil assets in return for leasing the rights to these assets for 1 System of National Accounts, 2008 (SNA). See Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008: 7.113. 2 Interest is adjusted to capture the value of services provided by financial institutions furnished without payment, which are directly generated by the production process. As such, measures of these services are imputed and recorded in the NIPA measures of output and income, as described later in this chapter and in the technical note to Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures. 3 Interest flows are offset entirely in the computation of gross domestic income. However, national income includes net interest received from the rest of the world, which is consistent with the treatment of interest in the System of National Accounts, 2008 (SNA).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-2 various productive uses. The sources and methods underlying miscellaneous payments are described in the appendix to this chapter. Definitions and Concepts The NIPAs provide measures of monetary and imputed interest transactions. The inclusion of monetary interest transactions in the NIPAs is straightforward; as explained in Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts, the income approach measure of GDP, or gross domestic income (GDI), is the sum of the income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services. The inclusion of “imputed” interest transactions warrants further explanation. Measures are imputed to reflect (1) the implicit income received by the financial services provider for the provision of services where explicit fees are not charged; these imputations allow the NIPAs to separately identify the value of financial services furnished without payment by commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, regulated investment companies, and by property and casualty insurance companies; (2) the under- or overfunding of defined benefit pension plans; and (3) certain transactions that are re-routed in the NIPAs so that they are attributed to the ultimate recipient and/or provider of the service rather than to intermediaries.4 This last category includes the allocation to policyholders of the interest earned on their behalf by life insurance carriers and by property and casualty insurance carriers, and the allocation to households of interest earned by pension funds. Financial services furnished without payment. Businesses often provide financial services related to investment activities that are not matched by explicit service charges, such as check processing, disbursing or transferring funds, bookkeeping, protecting deposited funds, and intermediation. Instead, payment for these services may be implicit, such as when banks pay depositors lower rates of interest or charge borrowers higher rates of interest than what they would otherwise charge, or when insurance companies charge lower premiums than they would in the absence of the interest earned on technical reserves. The NIPAs record imputed measures of these service charges to ensure that the accounts accurately reflect the final demand, output, and value added related to these services and to keep GDP invariant to whether banking services involve an explicit or implicit charge. These measures are recorded as both personal consumption expenditures and government consumption expenditures for financial services furnished without payment.5 A corresponding amount is recorded as interest income.

    "text": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-3 Under- or overfunding of defined benefit pension plans. The benefit entitlements of defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial calculations, and their value often does not coincide with the value of the assets that the plan has on hand; a plan that has a pay-as-you-go funding scheme might have only enough assets to ensure that it can make the current period’s benefit payments. Thus, a defined benefit pension plan may be, and often is, underfunded, implying that it does not have sufficient financial assets to meet its obligations. In other cases, the plan may be overfunded, implying that it has assets in excess of what are needed. As employers are usually liable to ensure the payment of promised benefits, the NIPAs record as a component of depositor services an imputed measure of the liability, in the case of underfunding, as imputed interest paid by the pension plans and received by persons. In the case of overfunding, the NIPAs record an imputed measure of the excess funds as negative imputed interest paid and received by the plans and by persons, respectively. Interest earned on behalf of others. The interest income that is earned by pension funds, by life insurance companies, and by property and casualty insurance carriers on technical reserves, as referenced above, is not actually distributed to persons in the current period. However, as the income is earned on their behalf, the NIPAs record it as imputed payments of interest to persons to accurately reflect by-sector income on an accrual basis. In effect, this rerouting implements a timing change so that the accrued interest is recorded as if it were disbursed to policyholders in the current period. Offsetting transactions are also recorded, whereby the policyholders reinvest the same amount of income in the pension fund or in the life insurance company or property and casualty insurance company in the form of household pension contribution supplements or as premium supplements, respectively.6 In the absence of these imputations, the investment returns and the increases in insurance reserves would be included in business and government income and saving rather than in personal income and saving. Table 14.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, payments and receipts of interest in the NIPAs. 6 See Brent R. Moulton and Eugene P. Seskin, “Preview of the 2003 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts,” Survey 83 (June 2003): 17-34.",

In the seven summary accounts of the NIPAs, “net interest and miscellaneous payments, domestic industries” is included as part of net operating surplus (a component of gross domestic income) in the Domestic Income and Product Account (Account 1). As noted above, the inclusion of net interest paid in these measures serves to offset the inclusion of net interest received in other components. Additionally, interest payments and receipts are recorded as part of the income and outlays of each domestic sector; as such, they are recorded in the Private Enterprise Account (account 2), in the Personal Income and Outlays Account (Account 3), and in the Government Receipts and Expenditures Account (Account 4); the interest flows between the nation and the rest of the world appear in the Foreign Transactions Current Account (Account 5). The NIPAs include a substantial number of tables that present nominal, or “current- dollar,” estimates of net interest paid and the gross interest flows of business, persons, and government. The following is a list of the principal NIPA tables that present estimates of interest for the nation and for sectors.9 1.7.5 Relation of Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Product, Net National Product, National Income, and Personal Income 1.10 Gross Domestic Income by Type of Income 1.12 National Income by Type of Income 1.13 National Income by Sector, Legal Form of Organization, and Type of Income 1.14 Gross Value Added of Domestic Corporate Business in Current Dollars and Gross Value Added of Nonfinancial Domestic Corporate Business in Current and Chained Dollars 8 For a discussion of domestic and national measures, see “Geographic Coverage,” in Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts. 9The NIPAs also present annual, quarterly, and monthly estimates of “Personal interest income” in NIPA table group 2 as a component of personal income. Annual and quarterly estimates of personal interest income are available in NIPA table 2.1. Personal Income and Its Disposition, and monthly estimates are available in NIPA table 2.6.

Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods As described earlier, the NIPA estimates, including those for interest payments and receipts, are prepared using a wide variety of source data (see “Chapter 3: Principal Source Data”) and using estimating methods that adjust the source data to the required NIPA concepts and that fill in gaps in coverage and timing (see “Chapter 4: Estimating Methods”). For monetary interest flows, the estimates are based primarily on statistical reports from the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) Statistics of Income (SOI) program, the Department of Agriculture, and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), and on administrative and regulatory agency reports from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). For imputed interest flows, the estimates are based primarily on data from the IRS’ SOI program, the FRB, the FDIC, and BEA’s International Transactions Accounts (ITAs), as well as trade association data from the National Credit Union Association, the Credit Union National Association, and the American Council of Life Insurers. Table 14.A following the main text summarizes the source data and estimating methods that are used to prepare the current-dollar annual estimates for measures of monetary and imputed interest paid and received as shown in NIPA table 7.11.

For monetary interest receipts, measures are provided for domestic corporate business (financial and nonfinancial), for financial sole proprietorships and partnerships, for other private business, for persons, for government, and for the rest of the world.11 “Other private business” is comprised of certain individuals that rent property and of tax-exempt cooperatives; persons is comprised of households, nonprofit institutions serving households, and owners of nonfinancial noncorporate businesses. Measures of imputed interest payments are also provided for selected sectors, but these measures are further distinguished by the type of service, as follows: (1) For imputed interest paid by providers of depositor, insurance, and pension services, measures are provided for domestic financial and nonfinancial corporations, for government, and for the rest of the world. (2) For imputed interest received by users of depositor, insurance, and pension services, measures are provided for domestic business (financial and nonfinancial corporations, sole proprietorships and partnerships, and other private business), for households and institutions, for government, and for the rest of the world. (3) For imputed interest paid by users of borrower services, measures are provided for domestic financial and nonfinancial corporate business, for sole proprietorships and partnerships, for other private business, for households and nonprofit institutions, for government, and for the rest of the world. (4) For (negative) imputed interest received by providers of borrower services, measures are provided for domestic financial corporations (i.e., banks, credit agencies, and investment companies) and for the rest of the world. The benchmark and nonbenchmark annual measures of interest paid and received are derived using the same methodologies. 10 For more information on NIPA sectors, see Chapter 2; see also Stephanie H. McCulla, Karin E. Moses, and Brent R. Moulton, “The National Income and Product Accounts and the System of National Accounts 2008: Comparison and Research Plans,” Survey 95 (June 2015): 1-17. 11 The mixed sectoring scheme employed in the NIPAs classifies “other private business”—that is, individuals that rent property and are required to report rental and royalty income on the IRS individual income tax return (or those that would be so required if they met size or income criteria), and tax-exempt cooperatives—as part of the business sector for production measures, and as part of the personal sector for income measures, with the exception of production-related interest transactions, such as interest payments on mortgage loans, which are classified in the business sector.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-8 Monetary interest For payments and receipts of monetary interest, annual measures are based on unique source data for each sector or, in some cases, subsector. For monetary interest paid and received by domestic corporate business and by sole proprietorships and partnerships, annual estimates except the most recent year are primarily based on data from the IRS SOI program.12 For the most recent year, SOI data are not available, and estimates are extrapolated using various indicators. For monetary interest payments, extrapolations primarily use Compustat data on interest expense by industry and FDIC Call Report tabulations of interest expense for financial corporations. For monetary interest receipts, the extrapolations are based on FDIC Call Report data on interest income. Estimates of monetary interest payments and receipts for Federal Reserve banks, a component of corporate financial business, are based on data from FRB annual reports. While the SOI data are largely consistent with the concepts and definitions underlying the NIPA estimates of interest payments and receipts, BEA makes several adjustments to account for differences in coverage and definitions. A reconciliation of the IRS and NIPA estimates of interest payments and receipts is published annually in NIPA table 7.17, a reproduction of which is shown for a single year in table 14.2 below.

Only financial corporations and the rest of the world pay imputed interest for depositor and insurance services; imputed interest payments for pension services are paid by financial and nonfinancial corporations, and by government. For financial corporations, the derivation of estimates of imputed interest paid for depositor and insurance services differs according to the specific type of institution. Specifically, for banks and credit agencies, measures are derived using the “reference rate approach,” in which the value of the services that are provided without explicit payment is measured as equal to the difference between the monetary interest paid to depositors or charged to borrowers and a “reference rate” that reflects the opportunity cost of borrowing or lending funds.17 For regulated investment companies, measures are derived as the sum of commissions and the imputed interest received from commercial banks on deposits the companies hold on behalf of its investors. For life insurance carriers, the NIPAs derive measures of the interest earned on the carriers’ technical reserves based on trade source data. For property and casualty insurance companies, the NIPAs measure the value of the services that are provided without explicit payments as equal to the expected investment income earned on technical reserves.18 For the rest of the world, the measures of imputed interest paid for depositor and insurance services are derived using the reference rate approach as described above. The total measures of imputed interest paid for depositor and insurance services are allocated to the receiving sectors (that is, financial and nonfinancial corporations, partnerships and proprietorships, other private business, households and institutions, government, and the rest of the world) based on their share of each type of asset held, based on data from the FRB’s Financial Accounts of the United States (FAUS) and on ITA data. For pension services, measures of interest are imputed to reflect the under- or overfunding of defined benefit employee pension plans for domestic financial and nonfinancial 17 The reference rate approach and the NIPA treatment and measurement of the output of depository institutions is described in Dennis J. Fixler, Marshall B. Reinsdorf, and George M. Smith, “Measuring the Services of Commercial Banks in the NIPAs,” Survey of Current Business 83 (September 2003): 33-44, and in Moulton and Seskin, 2003.

Specifically, the NIPAs derive measures of the liability reflected by under- or overfunding plans using an accrual accounting approach, in which the under- or overfunding is measured as equal to the difference between the actuarially determined present value of the plans’ liabilities (or “normal cost”) and the actual financial assets held by the plans.19 Only domestic and rest of the world financial institutions provide borrower services without explicit payment; the associated value of imputed interest is recorded as negative interest receipts for these sectors. Measures of the total imputation for banks, credit agencies, and investment companies are derived using the reference rate approach; the resulting negative totals are allocated to the borrowing sectors (domestic financial and nonfinancial institutions, sole proprietorships and partnerships, other private business, households and institutions, government, and the rest of the world) based on the share of each type of liability held by each sector from the FRB FAUS data and the ITAs. 20 Current quarterly estimates As with the annual measures, the quarterly measures of interest paid and received in the NIPAs are the sum of monetary interest and imputed interest. However, quarterly measures are provided only for select net interest aggregates and sectors, because the source data required for more detailed components are not consistently available on a quarterly basis. Specifically, the NIPAs provide quarterly measures of aggregate “net interest and miscellaneous payments, domestic industries” and “net interest and miscellaneous payments” for corporate business and for nonfinancial corporate business, but separate quarterly measures of interest payments and interest receipts are provided only for government and for persons.21 For “net interest and miscellaneous payments, domestic industries” in GDI, quarterly measures of net interest are derived as the residual of personal interest receipts less personal interest payments less net interest paid by government less net interest paid by the rest of the world. This derivation is based on the axiom that the total amount of interest paid by all sectors must equal the total interest received by all sectors, as follows: Bp + Pp + Gp + Fp = Br + Pr + Gr + Fr 19 The NIPA treatment and measurement of the over- or underfunding of defined benefit pension plans is described in Marshall B.

    "text": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-13 Where: Bp = interest paid by U.S. corporate business Pp = interest paid by persons Gp = interest paid by U.S. governments Fp = interest paid by the rest of the world to the United States and Br = interest received by U.S. corporate business Pr = interest received by persons Gr = interest paid by U.S. governments Fr = interest received by the rest of the world from U.S. business Rearranging the equation above shows that net interest paid for domestic industries (Bp – Br) can be measured as:22 Net domestic interest = (Pr – Pp) – (Gp – Gr) – (Fp – Fr) Following the axiom detailed above, for personal interest receipts, estimates are derived as the sum of monetary and imputed interest receipts. Quarterly monetary receipts are judgmentally extrapolated from the estimate for the previous quarter based on the FRB FAUS data on personal sector assets and on corresponding interest rates based on data from the Treasury Department’s Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays, from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, from market spot rates, and from Moody’s Corporation. Quarterly measures of personal imputed interest receipts for depositor, insurance, and pension services are derived as the sum of imputed interest paid to persons by the rest of the world and the share of total imputed interest paid by corporate business that is allocated to persons.23 Generally, the measures of total interest paid to persons by the rest of the world are based on ITA data; measures of imputed interest paid by corporate business are either extrapolated from the annual estimates or derived using the same source data and methods as the annual measures; for imputed interest paid by the rest of the world, the measures are based on ITA data.24 As with the annual estimates, the allocation of the interest paid by corporate business to persons is based on the FRB FAUS data. 22 For the measure “net interest and miscellaneous payments” in national income, this formula is adjusted to include receipts from, and exclude payments to, the rest of the world. 23 Persons and government do not receive imputed interest for borrower services. 24 For more information on the sources and methods underlying the ITA measures of exports and imports of services furnished without payment by financial intermediaries, see Elye Bliss, “Preview of the 2020 Annual Update of the International Economic Accounts,” Survey 100 (April 2020).",

    "text": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-14 For personal monetary interest payments, quarterly measures are derived as the sum of margin interest paid on security purchases and non-margin interest payments. For margin interest payments, the advance estimates are judgmentally extrapolated; second and third estimates are based on SEC FOCUS report data. For non-margin interest payments, quarterly measures are based on FRB data on consumer credit outstanding and a weighted average interest rate on that debt, as in the annual estimates. For personal imputed interest payments, measures are derived as the sum of (1) the share of imputed interest received by domestic business and by the rest of the world that is paid by persons for depositor, insurance, and pension services, and (2) the share of imputed interest received by domestic corporate business and by the rest of the world that is paid by persons for borrower services. Generally, the measures of total interest received by corporate business are either extrapolated from the annual estimates or derived using the same source data and methods as the annual measures; for imputed interest received by the rest of the world, the measures are based on ITA data. For the federal government, quarterly measures of net monetary interest paid are based on data from the Treasury Department’s Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays, data from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, ITA data on federal government monetary interest payments to, and receipts from, the rest of the world. For state and local governments, quarterly measures of both payments and receipts of monetary interest are judgmentally extrapolated. For federal and state and local government, quarterly measures are separately derived for imputed interest paid and received; measures of imputed interest paid are judgmentally extrapolated, and measures of imputed interest received are derived in the same way as imputed interest received by persons—as the sum of imputed interest paid to government by the rest of the world and the share of total imputed interest paid by corporate business that is allocated to government, based on FRB FAUS data. For the rest of the world, quarterly measures of monetary and imputed interest payments and receipts are based on ITA data.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 14: NET INTEREST 14-23 Appendix: Miscellaneous Payments Miscellaneous payments is a measure of the rent and royalty payments that accrue to federal and to state and local government owners of land or subsoil assets (that is, mineral deposits located within the earth or on the earth’s surface) in return for leasing the rights to these assets for various productive uses.25 Specifically, this includes federal government receipts from leasing federally-owned lands for mining or energy production and state and local receipts from allowing temporary possession of government-owned buildings, land, or other fixed properties; these include revenues such as grazing fees, timberland leases, and natural resource exploration and production. Bonus payments, which are typically one-time payments made to hold the land during the bidding process, are excluded because they are unrelated to production; the NIPAs record them as part of nonproduced assets.26 In the United States, rent—which the NIPAs treat as a distinct and separate transaction from rental payments made for housing—is paid during the initial, non- productive phase of a lease and reflects the “holding cost” of the lease. Royalties are paid during actual production and vary based on the market value of minerals extracted and sold during a set period of time.27 Table 14.A.1 shows the types of transactions that are included in, and excluded from, miscellaneous payments in the NIPAs. 25 Miscellaneous payments do not include rents and royalties that accrue to private landowners for the provision of rights to physical assets such as mineral rights as well as privately-owned intellectual property rights; these measures are included in rental income of persons, proprietors’ income, and corporate profits. 26 The NIPA treatment of rents and royalties is consistent with the recommendations of the SNA. The SNA groups rent and royalty payments together as “rents”; see paragraph 7.110 in Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank, System of National Accounts 2008, available at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/SNA2008.asp. 27 An additional category of royalties refers to payments made to use or reproduce copyrighted or patented resources; these transactions are treated as sales of services, which are unrelated to natural resources and are not included in the NIPA measure of miscellaneous payments.",

Rents and royalties are recorded in the NIPAs as a component of property income receipts and as a component of the aggregate “net interest and miscellaneous payments.” The following is a list of the principal NIPA tables that present estimates of rents and royalties. 1.12 National Income by Type of Income 1.13 National Income by Sector, Legal Form of Organization, and Type of Income 1.16 Sources and Uses of Private Enterprise Income 3.1 Government Current Receipts and Expenditures 3.2 Federal Government Current Receipts and Expenditures 3.3 State and Local Government Current Receipts and Expenditures Overview of Source Data and Estimating Methods Annual estimates For federal receipts of rents and royalties, annual estimates are based on data on total receipts from the leasing of rights to mineral resources, land, or royalty in kind oil, from the Treasury Department’s “Combined Statement of Receipts and Expenditures.” As the data include receipts of bonus payments for drilling rights, Department of Interior data on receipts of these bonus payments are used to remove them.

    "text": "APPENDIX: SUMMARY NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS APPENDIX: SUMMARY NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS (Updated: May 2019) This appendix presents the definitions of the line items that make up the seven summary national income and product accounts (NIPAs). These accounts simplify both the transactors and transactions in the U.S. economy. The transactors are shown in three distinct groups, or sectors— persons, businesses, and government; a fourth sector for the rest of the world is added to cover transactions between U.S. residents and foreign residents. The seven summary accounts show the contribution of each sector to the output of the economy, their income and outlays, and their saving and investment. The summary NIPAs, which are shown on the following three pages of this appendix, constitute a double-entry accounting system in which each of the entries in a summary account appears again in that account or in one of the other summary accounts. The numbers in parentheses indicate these “counter-entries.” In some cases, an entry may be equal to another entry in the summary accounts. For example, supplements to wages and salaries appears in account 1, line 5 and in account 3, line 14. In other cases, an entry may be equal to a combination of other entries (or parts of other entries). For example, for private enterprise interest payments (account 2, line 2), the counter-entry includes parts of private enterprise interest receipts (account 2, line 21, of personal interest income (account 3, line 20), of government interest receipts (account 4, line 20), and of interest payments to the rest of the world (account 5, line 13). For a description of the accounting principles that underlie the summary NIPAs, see the section “Accounting Framework” in “Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts.” For a more in-depth discussion, see U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, An Introduction to National Economic Accounting, Methodology Paper No. 1, September 2007.",

The right (product) side of the account shows GDP as the sum of final expenditures by consumers, private business, government, and foreigners, and the left (income) side of the account shows GDP as the sum of the incomes earned and the costs incurred in generating that production. Line 1–1: Compensation of employees, paid The total remuneration, both monetary and in kind, payable by employers to employees in return for their work during the period. It consists of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance). In the NIPAs, compensation is presented on an accrual basis—that is, it reflects compensation liabilities incurred by the employer in a given period regardless of when the compensation is actually received by the employee. Line 1–2: Wages and salaries The total remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; voluntary employee contributions to certain deferred compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans; employee gains from nonqualified stock options; receipts-in-kind; and miscellaneous compensation of employees, such as judicial fees to jurors and to witnesses.

In contrast, payments associated with the acquisition or disposal of assets are classified as capital transfers. Line 1–8: Net operating surplus A profits-like measure of the surplus accruing from the processes of production before deduction any explicit or implicit interest charges, rent, or other property incomes payable on financial assets, land, or other natural resources required to carry out production. It is equal to gross operating surplus less consumption of fixed capital. Line 1–9: Private enterprises (2–19) Consists of private business, the activities of households and institutions that are included within the production boundary of the NIPAs (primarily the services of owner-occupied housing), and, for the purpose of estimating monetary and imputed interest payments and receipts, nonprofit institutions serving households. Line 1–10: Current surplus of government enterprises (4–28) Current operating revenue and subsidies received from other levels of government less current expenses, such as intermediate purchases and employee compensation. In this calculation, no deduction is made for net interest paid, because the interest payments of government enterprises are not separately identified from other government interest in the government receipts and expenditures account. Line 1–11: Consumption of fixed capital (6–14) The NIPA measure of economic depreciation—that is, the decline in the value of the stock of fixed assets due to physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, and accidental damage except that caused by a catastrophic event. For nonprofit institutions serving households and for general government, Consumption of fixed capital serves as a measure of the value of the capital services of the fixed assets owned and used by these entities. Line 1–12: Gross domestic income The sum of incomes earned, and costs incurred in the production of gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic income (GDI) is equal to the sum of compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, net operating surplus, and consumption of fixed capital. In theory GDI should equal GDP, but in practice, they differ because their components are estimated using largely independent and less-than- perfect source data; this difference is termed the “statistical discrepancy.”",

The statistical discrepancy arises from the independent estimation of the two measures using different source data and methods. It is recorded in the NIPAs as an “income” component that reconciles the income side with the product side of the accounts. Line 1–14: GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BEA’s featured measure of U.S. production. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of the final goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States. GDP is equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. GDP is also equal to the sum of value added by industry across all industries. Line 1–15: Personal consumption expenditures (3–3) The primary measure of consumer spending in the U.S. economy. It is the NIPA final- demand component that measures the value of the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, “persons” who reside in the United States. Line 1–16: Goods Consists primarily of tangible products that can be stored or inventoried.

    "text": "1 GLOSSARY: NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS (Updated: November 2019) This glossary presents the definitions of terms that are associated with the U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs). The terms relate to the concepts, classifications, and accounting framework of the NIPAs, the general sources and methods used to prepare the NIPA estimates, and the line items that make up the seven summary NIPAs. For the most part, the NIPA definitions are consistent with those used in general economic accounting, such as the System of National Accounts (SNA); where appropriate, explanations of differences are provided. This glossary is intended to be a living reference that will be updated and expanded to reflect changes and additions as they are incorporated into the NIPA Handbook. Term Definition Accrual accounting Method of accounting that records the sale of goods or assets when ownership is transferred, the sale of services when they are provided, the generation of output when goods or services are produced, the consumption of intermediate goods and services when they are used, and the compensation of employees when it is earned. Administrative data Data tabulated as a byproduct of administering programs of the federal government and of state and local governments—such as processing corporate tax returns, regulating public utilities, issuing building permits, and handling unemployment insurance claims. “Advance” quarterly estimates First vintage of the three sets of current quarterly estimates of GDP and its components, the advance estimates are released near the end of the month that follows the end of the reference quarter. For most GDP components, the advance estimates are based on source data that cover 2 or 3 months of the quarter and that are subject to revision. Annual industry accounts Part of BEA’s industry economic accounts, these accounts consist of the annual input-output accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts. Annual input-output (I-O) accounts Part of BEA’s annual industry accounts, these accounts consist of a set of I-O tables—make table, use table, and several supplementary tables— that provide a time series of consistent statistics on the flow of goods and services that make up the production process of industries and to final users in the economy. For each year, beginning with 1998, the accounts show how industries interact as they provide inputs to, and use outputs from, each other to produce GDP. These accounts, which are consistent with the GDP-by-industry accounts, incorporate less comprehensive source data than those used for the benchmark I-O accounts.",

These updates incorporate newly available source data that are based on more extensive annual surveys, on annual data from other sources, and on revisions to the monthly and quarterly source data that were not available for incorporation into the NIPA current quarterly estimates.

In general, the chained-dollar estimates are calculated by multiplying the current-dollar value of an aggregate or component for the reference year by its corresponding chain-type quantity index and then dividing by 100. These estimates are denominated in units of the dollars of the reference year. The chained- dollar estimates may be used to calculate growth rates (which will be identical to those calculated using the quantity indexes), but because these estimates are not additive for periods other than the reference year, they should not be used to calculate component shares of an aggregate or to calculate component contributions to the growth of an aggregate. Chain-type indexes Quantity and price indexes that are based on the linking (chaining) of indexes for consecutive periods to form time series. In the NIPAs, annual changes in the quantities and prices calculated using a Fisher index formula that incorporates weights from 2 adjacent years are used to construct the chain-type indexes. These indexes eliminate the substitution bias found in indexes with unchanging (or “fixed”) weights, and their movements are not affected by the choice of the reference period. Change in private inventories (CIPI) The component of gross private domestic investment that measures the change in the physical volume of inventories—additions less withdrawals—owned by private business, valued in average prices of the period.

Next, the domestic supply of the commodity is allocated among domestic purchasers—that is, persons, business, and government. Finally, the estimates are converted to purchasers’ prices by adding transportation costs and trade margins. Compensation of employees The total remuneration, both monetary and in kind, payable by employers to employees in return for their work during the period. It consists of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance).

Command-basis gross national product (GNP) An alternative measure of real GNP that provides information on the real purchasing power of the income generated by the production of goods and services. It reflects the impact of changes in the prices of traded goods and services as well as changes in production. Command- basis GNP is calculated by deflating both “exports plus income receipts” and “imports plus income payments” by the price index for gross domestic purchases. Thus, it reflects the prices of purchased goods and services, while real GNP reflects the prices of produced goods and services. In the SNA, the term for this measure is “real gross national income.” Corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments The net income, before taxes, from current production of entities that are treated as corporations in the NIPAs. For corporate businesses, it is defined as gross output less the following expenses: intermediate inputs, compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports (less subsidies), consumption of fixed capital, net interest and miscellaneous payments, and business current transfer payments. The estimates are based on receipts less expenses from corporate income tax returns, with adjustments to account for differences between federal tax law and NIPA concepts. Among these differences are the following: receipts exclude net capital gains and dividends received; expenses exclude bad debt, depletion, and state and local taxes on corporate income; inventory withdrawals are valued at current cost; and depreciation is on a consistent accounting basis and valued at current-replacement cost. Coverage adjustments Adjustments that are made to source data in order to account for NIPA definitions and concepts or for information that is not contained in the source data, either because the data were not collected or because the data were incomplete. Current-cost The valuing of an asset at the prices prevailing at the time the valuation is made. It incorporates the effects of both depreciation and the changes in the market prices of that type of asset. For example, the 2010 current- cost estimate for an asset is based on the price that would have been paid to acquire that asset in 2010, and the 2011 current-cost estimate for that asset is based on the price that would have been paid to acquire that asset in 2011.",

    "text": "8 Current-dollar estimates Estimates valued in the prices of the period when the transactions occurred—that is, at “market value.” Also referred to as “nominal estimates” or as “current-price estimates.” Current production Production that takes place during the current period—that is, during the period being measured. In measuring GDP, the final sales recorded for product-side components—such as personal consumption expenditures— in the current period may include goods that were produced in earlier periods, so the recording of changes in inventories provides a means to allocate production to the period in which it actually occurred. Current quarterly estimates Three sets of NIPA estimates that provide initial pictures of U.S. economic activity for a given quarter. These estimates are released successively in the 3 months following the end of the quarter: the “advance” estimates are released near the end of the first month, the “second” estimates are released near the end of the second month, and the “third” estimates are released near the end of the third month. Current surplus of government enterprises Current operating revenue and subsidies received from other levels of government less current expenses, such as intermediate purchases and employee compensation. In this calculation, no deduction is made for net interest paid, because the interest payments of government enterprises are not separately identified from other government interest in the government receipts and expenditures account. Current transfer payments (net) Cash or in-kind transactions in which one of the parties receives nothing directly in return, such as unemployment benefits paid by government to persons. Excludes payments that are associated with the acquisition or disposal of fixed assets, such as estate taxes or gift taxes (see “capital transfers”). Defense Portion of federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment that covers the military activities of the U.S. Department of Defense and the defense-related activities of other government agencies, such as certain atomic energy activities of the U.S. Department of Energy. Deflation method The most common method for preparing inflation-adjusted, or “quantity,” estimates for most detailed NIPA components. In this method, the quantity estimate for a NIPA component is derived by dividing its current-dollar value by the value of an appropriate price index—that is, one whose definition and coverage most closely match those of the series being deflated. Depletion The reduction in the value of deposits of subsoil assets (such as minerals and oil) as a result of the physical removal and using up of the assets, and the reduction in the value of uncultivated biological assets (such as natural forests and fish stocks in the open seas) beyond sustainable levels of extraction. In the NIPAs, natural resource discoveries are not considered to be capital formation, so reductions in these resources are not treated as charges against current production.",

The retail control method provides the indicator series that are used in interpolating and extrapolating the estimates for most PCE goods components, and it provides the aggregate indicator of the period-to-period change for this group of components. In this method, data on sales by kind of business from annual and monthly retail trade surveys are allocated among these PCE categories (known as the PCE control group) based on product-line data from the economic census.
