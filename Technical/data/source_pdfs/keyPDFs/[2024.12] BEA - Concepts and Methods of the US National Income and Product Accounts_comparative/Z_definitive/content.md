Preface 
 
The “NIPA Handbook” begins with introductory chapters that describe the 
fundamental concepts, definitions, classifications,  and accounting  framework that 
underlie the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) of the United States and the 
general sources and methods that are used to prepare the NIPA estimates. It continues 
with separate chapters that describe the sources and methods that are used to prepare the 
expenditure and income components of the accounts and presents an appendix that defines 
each entry in the seven summary NIPA accounts and a glossary of terms that are 
associated with the NIPAs. The Handbook is intended to be a living reference that can be 
updated to reflect changes in concepts or methodology as they are introduced into the 
NIPAs. 
This release of the NIPA Handbook updates the existing chapters to reflect the 
2024 annual update of the NIPAs. Additional chapters will be incorporated as they 
become available.

Table of Contents 
 
 
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
 
The U.S. national income and product accounts (NIPAs) are a set of economic 
accounts that provide the framework for presenting detailed measures of U.S. 
output and income. This chapter introduces the NIPAs by answering several basic 
questions about their nature and purpose. 
 
CHAPTER 2: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 
 
The NIPAs are based on a consistent set of concepts and definitions. This chapter 
establishes the type and scope of the economic activities that are covered by the 
NIPA measures, and it describes several of the principal NIPA measures of these 
activities. It then discusses the classifications used in presenting the NIPA 
estimates, and it describes the accounting framework that underlies the NIPAs. 
 
CHAPTER 3: PRINCIPAL SOURCE DATA 
 
The NIPAs incorporate a vast amount of data from a variety of public and private 
sources. This chapter describes the principal source data that are used to prepare 
the current quarterly NIPA estimates, to prepare the annual revisions of the 
NIPAs, and to prepare the quinquennia l comprehensive revisions of the NIPAs. 
 
CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATING METHODS 
 
Estimating methods are the steps that are taken to transform source data into 
estimates that are consistent with the concepts, definitions, and framework of the 
NIPAs. This chapter briefly describes some of the general methods that are used 
to prepare the current-dollar, quantity, and price estimates for the NIPAs. An 
appendix describes some of the statistical tools and conventions that are used in 
preparing and presenting the NIPA estimates. 
 
CHAPTER 5: PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES 
 
Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) is the NIPA measure of consumer 
purchases of goods and services in the U.S. economy. A technical note at the end 
of the chapter provides additional detail on the methodology for a number of key 
PCE components.

CHAPTER 6: PRIVATE FIXED INVESTMENT 
 
Private fixed investment (PFI) is the NIPA measure of spending by private 
business, nonprofit institutions, and households on fixed assets in  the U.S. 
economy. A technical note at the end of the chapter provides additional detail on 
the methodology for several key PFI components. 
 
CHAPTER 7: CHANGE IN PRIVATE INVENTORIES 
 
Change in private inventories is the NIPA measure of the value of the change in the 
physical volume of inventories owned by private businesses in the U.S. economy. 
Appendixes at the end of the chapter illustrate the relationship between business 
and NIPA inventory accounting and the basic steps used in the NIPA inventory 
calculations. 
 
CHAPTER 8: NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES 
 
Net exports of goods and services is the difference between U.S. exports of goods 
and services, the NIPA measure of the portion of U.S. production that is provided 
to the rest of the world, and imports of goods and services, the NIPA measure of 
the portion of U.S. expenditures that is accounted for foreign-produced goods and 
services. 
 
CHAPTER 9: GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND GROSS 
INVESTMENT 
 
Government consumption expenditures and gross investment is the NIPA 
measure of the portion of final expenditures that is accounted for by the 
government sector. In the NIPAs, government is treated as both a 
consumer/investor and a producer of goods and services. 
 
CHAPTER 10: COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES 
 
Compensation measures the total income—both wages and salaries and 
supplements to wages and salaries—earned by employees in return for 
contributing to production during an accounting period. 
 
CHAPTER 11: NONFARM PROPRIETORS’ INCOME 
 
Nonfarm proprietors’ income provides a comprehensive and consistent economic 
measure of the income earned by all U.S. unincorporated nonfarm businesses. 
 
CHAPTER 12: RENTAL INCOME OF PERSONS 
 
Rental income of persons reflects the income earned by persons for the provision, 
to others, of their property.
