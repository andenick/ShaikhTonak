"""the most frequent complaint about current trends in financial markets is",,
that  so  much  talented  human  capital  is  devoted  to  trading  paper  assets,,
,"rather  than  to  actually  creating  wealth'9 (cited in Chernomas  1991, p. 2;",
emphasis added).,,
,"In like vein, Thurow (1980, p. 88) has argued that while ""security guards",
,"protect old goods,  [they] do  not produce  new goods  since they add  noth-",
,"ing to  output""  (emphasis added), and that military activities are ""a form",
,"of  public consumption"" which ""use up a lot of  human and economic re-",
,"sources"" (Thurow  1992, p.  20).  The New  York  Times has expressed  the",
,"same sentiment,  noting that ""[s]ecurity people -  or guard labor, as some",
,economists call them -  are proliferating...  [in] a nation trying to protect,
,"itself  from  crime and violence."" It goes  on to  quote  Harvard  University",
,"economist  Richard  Freeman  to  the  effect  that  if  "" 'you  go  to  a  sneaker",
,"outlet  in a not-so-poor  neighborhood  in Boston,  there will be three pri-",
,vate guards.  . . . We are employing  many people who are essentially  not,
,"producing  anything'""  (Uchitelle  1989, emphasis added).",
,The growth of the military and the bureaucracy is endemic in the post-,
,"war  world,  in  developed  and  developing  countries  alike.  Within  many",
,"parts  of  the  capitalist  world  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  the  same  was true",
,"of financial and trading activities.  At  present in the American  economy,",
,guard  labor  is  one  of  the  most  rapidly  growing  forms  of  employment.,
,"Within an orthodox  national  accounts  framework,  all such activities are",
,viewed  as  resulting  in  additional  output.  But  within  a  classical  frame-,
,"work,  because  these  same  activities  are  viewed  as  forms  of  social  con-",
,"sumption,  their relative growth is seen as serving to absorb an increased",
,portion  of  the  national  product  and  hence  lower the share available  for,
,investment and accumulation. The difference between the two approaches,
,"has an impact not only on the measures of  national production,  but also",
,on the very understanding  of  the observed  patterns of  growth  and stag-,
,"nation.  In a world full of  burgeoning militaries, bureaucracies, and sales",
,"forces,  such  matters  can  assume  great  significance  at the most  practical",
level.,,
,"As  noted  previously,  conventional  national  accounts  have  been  criti-",
,cized from a variety of viewpoints in recent years. We share many of the,
,expressed concerns about the desirability of extending and improving the,
,coverage of such accounts. But our primary concern is with the very defi-,
,"nition  of  production  itself,  since  this  lies  at  the  heart  of  all  systems  of",
,"accounts.  In  the  next  two  sections,  we  will  briefly  trace  the  history  of",
,national  accounts  and  outline  the  basic  structure  of  various  alternative,
,systems of accounts currently under discussion. Section 4 will summarize,
,the essential differences between our approach and those which fall within,
the tradition of  orthodox  economics.,,
