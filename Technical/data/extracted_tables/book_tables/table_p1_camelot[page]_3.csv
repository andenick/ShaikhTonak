"generally  match,  because  the  totals  for  a  given  input-output  table are"
benchmarked on NIPA estimates available when that particular table was
created  whereas  currently  available  NIPA  data  incorporate many revi-
sions of earlier estimates.
"For  all  of  these  reasons,  one  cannot  simply  use  NIPA  data to  fill  in"
"observations  between IO benchmark years.  Instead, we use NIPA data"
directly  for  components  such  as  GVAP  or  CON  (containing  the  latest
available revisions) and indirectly to interpolate between benchmark esti-
mates of  other components such as Mp or RYcon.
"Consider the estimation of  the total value TV. By definition, we can"
write this as (see Figure 5.1):
