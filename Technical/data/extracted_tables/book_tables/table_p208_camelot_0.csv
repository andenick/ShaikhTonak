Critical  analysis  of previous  empirical  studies,189
adjusted  rate of  surplus value  is generally  higher than  his nominal  rate.,
Our  estimates  in  Section  5.9  are  based  on  Shaikh  and  Tonak's  (forth-,
coming) extension of these calculations; their effect on the rate of surplus,
value was shown in Figure  5.24.,
,"Papadimitriou  (1988) analyzes the Greek  economy  from  1958 to 1977,"
using essentially  the same schema as we do; any concrete differences  are,
due  to  data  limitations.  Variable  capital  is  defined  as  the  wages  of  all,
"workers in the production sector, net of  estimated corporate officers' sal-",
"aries  (p.  152).  Also,  the  entire  real  estate  sector  is treated  as  a  royalties",
"sector, since no consistent evidence could be found on its division between",
building  rents  and ground  rent  (p.  155).  Papadimitriou  constructs  mea-,
"sures of the rate of surplus value, the organic composition of capital, and",
of the rate of profit.  The latter two are adjusted for variations in capacity,
utilization  by means  of  a Wharton-type  measure  of  the rate of  capacity,
"utilization, which he also constructs (p. 157). For the two decades spanned",
"by his data, Papadimitriou finds that the rate of  surplus value rises mod-",
,"estly, ranging from 2449b in 1958 to a peak of 31797b in 1976, and then falls"
"back to 288% in 1977. Over this same interval, however, the organic com-",
position  of  capital  (defined  as the ratio  of fixed capital to  variable capi-,
"tal,  divided  by the rate of  capacity  utilization)  rises much more sharply,",
"by  over  709b.  The  general  rate  of  profit  falls  steadily,  by  roughly  309b",
"overall  (p.  153, table 20).  Papadimitriou  also shows that the rate of  sur-",
"plus  value  S*/V*  is  about  509b  larger,  and  rises  more  rapidly,  than  the",
"broadly defined  profit/wage  ratio P/W  (pp. 170-1). Similarly, the Marx-",
ian measure  of  productivity  is almost  twice  as large as a  conventionally,
"defined  measure  (p.  176); thus,  neither  conventional  measure  is  a  good",
"proxy for its Marxian counterpart.  However, he does find that the Marx-",
"ian  measure  of  GVA*  is  well  approximated  by  GNP.  This  implies  that,",
"for  the  Greek  economy,  the  great  source  of  variation  between  Marxian",
and orthodox categories arises from the difference  between variable cap-,
ital and all wages.52,
,"In an independent  study,  Tsaliki  and Tsoulfidis  (1988) provide  a sim-"
"ilar  set  of  estimates  for  the  Greek  economy,  also  for  1958-73.  Working",
"with the 35-sector Greek input  output tables in current prices, they esti-",
"mate the money forms of the rate of surplus value, the value composition",
"of  capital,  and  the  rate  of  profit,  all  for  the  nonagricultural  economy.",
"They divide the economy  into three sectors: nonagricultural  production,",
"which  includes  productive  services; circulation,  which consists  of  trade,",
