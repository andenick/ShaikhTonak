2.1  The distinction between production and
nonproduction  activities
Marxist national accounts depend crucially on the distinction be-
tween labor which is productive of capital and that which is not. Because
this distinction is so often presented in a confused and contradictory man-
"ner, we will not begin from it. Instead, this section will focus on the prior"
and more general distinction between production and nonproduction ac-
tivities. The next section will then develop this into more concrete distinc-
tions between labors which are and are not productive of capital. As we
"shall see, our derivation will enable us to arrive at a definition that corre-"
sponds  exactly to the one Marx uses. Deriving the definition  from first
"principles,  rather  than  simply  beginning  with  it,  allows  us to  endow  it"
with considerably greater depth.
2.1.1  Mistaken conceptions of the distinction
It is useful to begin by emphasizing what the distinction between
"production and nonproduction labor does not refer to. In the first place, it"
is not a distinction between necessary and unnecessary activities. We intend
no connotation that production activities are either more (or less) necessary
than  nonproduction  activities. The dividing line does not  rest  on either
"technical  or  social  standards  of  efficiency,  though  of  course  such  stan-"
dards may well be applied to either set of activities. Baran and Sweezy's
argument  that  some labor  under  capitalism  would  be unnecessary  in a
"""rationally  ordered"" (i.e. socialist)  economy  (Baran  1957, p.  32) is one"
such efficiency  approach.  But it is easy to  show that  they draw the dis-
"tinction between ""productive"" and ""unproductive"" labor in ways that are"
"quite different  from those in Marx (Hunt 1979, pp. 304-8), and certainly"
from  those which we will develop.
