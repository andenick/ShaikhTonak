,"that whereas S continues to be greater than P+  and P, the present  finding",
,that VA > VA (see Table 3.5) is actually reversed at a more concrete level.,
,Table 3.12 will summarize these and other general patterns in our  findings.,
3.1.3  Further  types  of  trading  activities,,
,We indicated  in Table 3.1 that the definition  of  trading  activities,
,encompasses  not  only  private  wholesale/retail  trade  but  also  any  trad-,
,"ing done by government enterprises, as well as distributive transport and",
the  rental  of  buildings  and  equipment.  Because  input-output  accounts,,
,place  specific  government  enterprises  in the  same industries  as their pri-,
,"vate  counterparts  (BEA  1980,  p.  45),  we  can  assume  that  government",
,trading enterprises are already part of  the overall trade sector.,
,The  treatment  of  transportation  is  similar  to  that  of  trade  in  IO  ac-,
,"counts  (see  Section  3.1.2).  That  is  to  say,  only  transportation  margins",
,"enter  into the transportation  sector's gross  output  and product,  and the",
,"individual  margins are all ""unbundled  and shifted  forward"" (BEA 1980,",
,"p.  20).  Thus,  if  we  were  able  to  estimate  the  portion  of  transportation",
,"which qualifies  as distributive transport,  we could in principle merge this",
,directly into the trade sector. But in practice the necessary information is,
,"lacking, so that our empirical estimates are based on the assumption that",
all transportation is productive  transport.,,
,The identification  of  building and equipment  rentals is more complex.,
,"To  begin  with,  the  overall  real  estate  and  rental  sector  in  conventional",
,accounts is comprised of three disparate activities. The first is a fictitious,
,"(imputed)  component  known  as ""owner-occupied  rentals,"" arising  from",
,the fact that IO-NIPA  accounts treat homeowners who live in their own,
,houses  as if  they were businesses  renting  out their homes to themselves.,
,"This must be discarded altogether.  Second is the rental and sale of  land,",
,which we will shift to the secondary sector (along with finance) since such,
,"activities really amount to the recirculation of revenues, titles, and claims",
,"to  revenues.  The third  activity  is the sale and rental  of  buildings,  which",
,involves either the direct or piecemeal sale of a produced commodity and,
must therefore  be merged into the overall trade sector.,,
,"Furthermore, IO accounts treat building and equipment rentals as pro-",
,"duction  activities,  whereas  we  need  to  treat  them  as  trading  activities;",
,this means that when we merge building /equipment  rentals (br) into the,
,"total  trade sector  (tt), we must ensure that only the rental margins enter",
,into gross output and product and that the individual rental margins (the,
,low elements of the sector) are unbundled and shifted forward. Figure 3.7,
,summarizes the overall treatment of the primary flows. All further  detail,
is reserved  for Appendix  A.,,
