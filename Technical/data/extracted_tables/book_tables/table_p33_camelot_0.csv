except that we would distinguish between production and nonproduction
"activities, and also between capitalist and noncapitalist activities - just as"
we do in the case of  legal market activities (see Chapter 2).
A second common characteristic of extended accounts is that they strive
to  integrate  the  treatment  of  sectoral  wealth  stocks  with  corresponding
"production-flow accounts. However, in attempting to do this, conventional"
"accounts adopt the business sector as their basic model.  In business, pur-"
chases of  plant  and equipment  are capital  investments that yield returns
(profits)  in subsequent years. On the (false) premise that the salient char-
"acteristic  of  business  fixed  capital  is  its  durability,19  extended  accounts"
"treat  stocks  of  consumer  durables  (houses,  cars,  shoes,  clothing,  equip-"
"ment,  and  furnishings)  and  government  durables  (building  and  equip-"
"ment) as household  and government  ""capital,"" respectively  (Eisner 1988,"
"p.  1653).  Of  course,  unlike  business  capital,  there  is  no  actual  profit 
-"
"indeed,  no  revenue  at  all  -  attached.  It  therefore  becomes  necessary  to"
"impute  a  stream  of  ""services"" to  household  and  government  durables,"
and  add  these  imputed  amounts  to  the  measure  of  national  product.20
Official  accounts already carry out such imputations  for  owner-occupied
"housing, in which private homeowners are treated as unincorporated busi-"
nesses renting out their homes to themselves for fictitious sums of  money
"(BEA  1980,  p.  47).  Most  extended  accounts  follow  a similar  procedure"
"for  so-called  intangible  capital,  cumulating  health and education expen-"
"ditures to derive a stock  of  ""human capital"" and cumulating business re-"
"search  and  development  to  get  a  stock  of  business  ""intangible"" capital"
"(Eisner  1988, p.  1670, table  S.I).  As  a corollary,  it becomes necessary  to"
"shift all household and government expenditures on durables, health, and"
education  from  the category  of  current  expenditures  to  a newly  created
"category of  capital ""investment"" expenditures."
"As  far  as we are concerned,  the conventional  treatment  conflates  two"
"distinct issues. On one hand, they are quite right to stress the importance"
"of  keeping  track  of  the  stocks  of  household  and  consumer  wealth,  and"
of  integrating the formation  of  these stocks into corresponding flows of
"revenue.  On  the  other  hand,  we  would  argue  that  it  is  wrong  to  treat"
"mere  durable  goods  as  if  they  were  equivalent  to  business  capital,  and"
even  worse  to  impute  fictitious  profits  to  such goods.  The  capital  stock
"of  a business is part of  a profit-making  venture,  and comprises not  only"
