,Wolff  derives  the  very  same  expression  for  the  relation  between  his,
measure  of  the rate of  surplus value e' and the average rate of  exploita-,,
"tion e,  noting in passing that the ""rate of  surplus value can thus increase",,
,from  . ..  an increase in the ratio of  unproductive to productive  employ-,
,"ment"" (1987,  p.  85).  He  does  not  comment  on  this  rather  extraordinary",
conclusion.,,
,It is possible to extract Wolff's labor value estimates of the average rate,
,"of  exploitation  e,  which is really the rate of  surplus value e as we would",
,define  it  (since  he  calculates  e  by  assuming  that  unproductive  workers,
,consume  the  same  basket  as  productive  workers).  He  presents  data  for,
"1-rt,","from  which  we  can  calculate  e =  (l -n)/n,",which  is  the  same  as
e =  S/V  as we would define it.61,,
,"Finally, Khanjian (1989) provides a set of consistent estimates of  labor",
,"value  and  money  rates  of  surplus  value  in  the  United  States,  based  on",
,"the  procedures  developed  in  Shaikh  (1975).  As  discussed  in  Section 4.1,",
,Khanjian's data clearly demonstrate that price-value deviations are small,
,in their effects  on the measurement  of  the rate of  surplus value: S/V  dif-,
,"fers from SVV* by only 6%-9%,  and the trends of the two are virtually",
,identical. This immediately implies that money value estimates of the rate,
,of  surplus value  are generally  excellent  proxies  for  the underlying  labor,
,value  rates.  But  Khanjian's  numerical  estimates  are  substantially  larger,
,"than  ours,  because  he  makes  no  adjustment  for  the wage  equivalent  of",
,proprietors and partners in the noncorporate sector. Such an adjustment,
,(which we do incorporate) reduces the measure of surplus value and raises,
,the measure of  variable capital.  This is also why our estimates are lower,
"than those in Wolff,  other things being equal.",,
,Table 6.10 compares the implicit estimates of  the value rate of  surplus,
,"value in Wolff (1987) to his own earlier estimates (1977b, p.  103, table 3),",
,"to  those  in Khanjian  (1989,  table  19),  and to  our money  rate of  surplus",
