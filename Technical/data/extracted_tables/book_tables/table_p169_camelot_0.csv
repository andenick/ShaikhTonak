Figure  5.26.  Approximation  to the rate of  surplus value.
Source:  Table 5.13.
"NIPA-based  general  rate  and  the  observed  corporate  rate,  all  three  ex-"
"hibited  similar  tendencies  to  decline  from  1948 to  1980,  and then  to re-"
"verse themselves slightly thereafter.  Finally, we found that it was possible"
to  construct  a  good  approximation  to  the  rate  of  surplus  value  largely
from  NIPA  data  alone.  This  allows  us the  possibility  of  estimating  the
rate of  surplus value for countries and periods in which the detailed data
we would prefer is unavailable.
"There  were  some  surprises  in  the  data,  in  that  several  key  Marxian"
ratios were extremely stable over the entire postwar period. The produc-
"tive and trade-sector shares of total value, and the intermediate and  final-"
"use  shares  of  the  total  product,  both  remained  virtually  constant  over"
"time,  as  shown  in  Figures  5.5  and  5.6.  A  similar  and  interesting  result"
was the close parallelism between the unit wages of productive and unpro-
"ductive  workers  in  Figures  5.10  and  5.11,  and  hence  between  the  ratios"
"V/W  and L p/L  in Figure 5.9.  Finally,  there was the surprising  stability"
of the share of the surplus product absorbed by unproductive government
"activities, as depicted in Figure 5.21."
The data also uncovered some strong empirical trends. The rate of sur-
"plus  value  S/V  rose  significantly  over  the  postwar  period,  as  did  the"
"value composition  of  capital C/V  and the productivity  of  labor q,  as"
"seen  in  Figures  5.13,  5.15,  and  5.19.  respectively.  The  Marxian  rate  of"
