"35  Mandel  (1975, p.  176) criticizes  Mage  for  leaving  taxes  out
 of his measure of sur-"
plus  value.
36  Mage  also  subtracts  corporate  officers'  salaries  from  wages  and  adds  them  to  his
"estimate of  aggregate surplus value.  In effect,  we do the same thing (see  Appendix"
"G),  so  this does  not  account  for  any difference  between  the two  sets
 of measures."
"37  Mage's measure of  capital  consumption  is also different  from  ours,  since they are"
derived  from  different  capital  stock  data.
38  We start by adding the wage equivalent  in each  sector to employee  compensation
in each  sector to  obtain  total  wages  in each  sector.  Then  one  portion  of  this  total
"is  allocated  to variable  capital,  and  the  rest   to unproductive  wages.  When  the"
former  is  subtracted  from  Marxian  value  added  (which  includes  all  wages  in  the
"production  and  trade  sectors)   to get  surplus  value,  the  remainder  automatically"
"includes  the  unproductive  wages   of the  production  and  trade  sectors, 
including"
corporate  officers'  salaries  (which  NIPA  lists  under  employee  compensation).
39  Because  estimates of the  ratio of productive  to  unproductive  labor  (or  wages)  in
each  sector  are  used   to split  total  wages  into  variable  capital  and  unproductive
"wages,  differences  in estimates  of  these ratios also contribute  to the difference  be-"
tween  Mage's figures  and  ours.  But these do  not appear to be a significant  factor.
