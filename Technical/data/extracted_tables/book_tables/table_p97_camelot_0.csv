,In expression (a) we can move the term (GOry + GOdy) to the right-hand,
,side and expand it by means of  expressions (b) and (c) to  obtain,
GOp + GOtt s  (Mp + Mtt + Mry) + (RYp 4- RYtt + RYry -  GOry) -I- CON +1,,

,"But the preceding expression is simply the equality TV = TP, as can",
,be  seen  by comparing  it  with  expression  (d).  It  follows  that  VA = FD,
,"and  S = SP,  since these latter two  relations  are derived  by  subtracting",
"equal elements from TV and TP,  respectively.",,
