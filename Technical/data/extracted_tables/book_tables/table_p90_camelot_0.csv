T = Net transfer of value through foreign trade = Tx -  Tim
=  ( X  - I M  ) - ( X V - I M V ).
The net transfer of value T (expressed in its money equivalent) is there-
fore  the  difference  between  the  conventional  realized-value  measure  of
the balance of trade (X — IM)17 and the corresponding labor value mea-
sure (Xv —IMV). This  means that  adding  T to  the revenue and use sides
of  conventional  accounts  will  replace the realized  values  recorded there
with  the  corresponding  produced  values.  The  resulting  total  value  and
"total product will then correctly measure produced,  rather than realized,"
magnitudes.
"In estimating  the  net  international  transfer  of  value  T,  it  is  useful  to"
express it in a somewhat different  form.  Let
"d,, s  (X - X v ) / X  = the percentage deviation of  basic export"
