The Marxian measure of productivity q* is the primary one. It is derived
by deflating  our measure of total product TP* by the GNP price deflator
"py (in 1982 dollars), and then dividing by hours of productive labor Hp to"
obtain  hourly  productivity.  Because  orthodox  measures  of  productivity
"are based  on  value  added  rather than total  product,  we also calculate a"
"quasi-Marxian  measure  y*,  which  is  real  Marxian value  added  per pro-"
"ductive worker hour. This differs greatly in level from q*,  but has essen-"
"tially the same trend, because the proportion CVTP* of circulating con-"
"stant  capital  to total  product  is extremely stable (see Section  5.2,  Figure"
"5.6, and Appendix E). These Marxian productivity measures are listed in"
Table J.I.
Orthodox measures of  productivity vary considerably.  The most com-
"mon one is real GDP per employee hour, which we call y. Also  available"
is the  BLS measure y!  of  real  GDP  originating  in the nonfarm  business
sector by their estimate of  hours of  persons engaged in production (em-
ployees  plus  self-employed  persons)  in  this  same  sector.  Since  the  BLS
"measure is only available in index-number  form,  we calculate an equiva-"
"lent  measure  of  productivity  y2  in  the  nonfarm  business  sector,  as  the"
ratio of  real GDP to total  hours of  all persons engaged. The total-hours
measure  H2  is  in  turn  calculated  by  multiplying  the  average  hours  per
full-time equivalent employee in domestic industries (from NIPA) by esti-
mated  nonfarm  total  employment  (based  on  our  employment  data  in
Table F.I).
Table J.I presents the calculations  of  Marxian and orthodox  measures
"of  productivity,  along with associated measures of hours worked."
