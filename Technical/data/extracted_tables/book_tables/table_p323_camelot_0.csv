Our  primary  database  for  wages  comes  from  NIPA.  We use employee
compensation  (EC) because it includes  wages and salaries of  employees
as well as employer contributions to social security. This is the appropri-
"ate base for estimates of variable capital, since it represents the total cost"
of  labor power to the capitalist.
A combination of BLS and NIPA data is used to estimate the wage per
production worker. This is then applied to the estimate of the number of
productive workers from Appendix F to derive the total wage bill of pro-
ductive labor (variable capital). The wage bill of unproductive workers is
derived  as  the  difference  between  total  NIPA  wages  and total  variable
capital. The basic steps involved will now be outlined.
"Starting  with  the  NIPA  measure  of  employee  compensation  EC, we"
"make two adjustments. First, because EC covers only employees whereas"
our  measure  of  total  employment  L includes  both  employees  and self-
"employed persons, we need to make some estimate of the wage equivalent"
"of  self-employed  persons. Second, we must split the resulting measure of"
total wages into wages of productive and unproductive workers. Let
"EC, = total employee compensation in they th sector (NIPA);"
"FEE, = total full-time equivalent employees in they th sector (NIPA);"
