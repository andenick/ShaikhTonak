,"value added to gross value added, justifying  it on the somewhat  specious"
"grounds that this ""allows direct calculation in labor-units and is therefore",
,"preferable in the current context"" (1963, p.  197). In fact,  his theoretically"
,preferred  measure  of  the  value  of  money  is  readily  calculable  from  his
,"data,  whereas  the  measure  he  actually  uses  requires  him  to  engage  in a"
,"very  roundabout,  iterative  estimation  procedure  (pp.  198,  212-14).  His"
,"justification  for all of this makes no sense, save to provide slightly differ-"
ing estimates in the two sets of  measures.,
,"There  is  another  side  to  this  matter.  In  recent  years,  several  authors"
,(Foley 1982; Lipietz 1982) have tried to turn Mage's algebraic identity into
,"a ""new"" solution to the transformation  problem by simply defining  both"
,the value of labor power and the value of money in the appropriate man-
,ner.  What  they  neglect  to  mention  are the implications  of  such a proce-
,"dure. As just defined, the value of money A is the living labor commanded"
,in exchange by the net product. This means that the value of labor power
V,is the living  labor  commanded  by the money  wage bill  of  productive
,"workers,  and that surplus value S' is simply the living labor  commanded"
,by  the  existing  mass  of  profit.  Marx  argued  that  price  and  profits  were
,monetary forms of value and surplus value. The new approach abandons
,this altogether by defining surplus value to be a form of profit! The whole
,"relation between surplus value and profit is turned on its head. Moreover,"
,"this approach does not even have the virtue of being new, since it is really"
,nothing more than Adam  Smith's second definition  of  labor value as the
,living  labor  commanded  by price.  Ricardo  and Marx decisively  rejected
"this approach,  with good  reason.",
,"In summary, Mage pioneers the analysis of the relation between Marx-"
,"ian  categories  and  national  income  accounts  (albeit  only  on  the  value,"
,"as opposed  to  the product,  side of  the accounts).  He is theoretically  so-"
,"phisticated,  and  extraordinarily  knowledgeable  about  empirical  issues."
,He  correctly  identifies  the  money  form  of  total  value  as the  sum  of  the
,gross  output  (in  the  IO  sense)  of  the  production  and  trade  sectors.  His
,"treatment  of  variable  capital  is also  a major  step  forward,  since he gen-"
,eralizes  Varga's  distinction  between  productive  and  unproductive  labor
,within manufacturing  to all productive sectors. But his text is  frustrating
,because it  does  not  provide  any  systematic  treatment  of  the relation be-
,tween Marxian and NIPA categories. Rather than starting with total value
,"or even value added and then working down to surplus value, he proceeds"
,instead  by  building  up  the  latter  from  a  variety  of  data  sources.  Items
,"such as unproductive wages, taxes of various sorts, and the wage equiva-"
,lent  of  proprietors  and  partners  tend  to  get  lost  in  such  a  process.  But
,perhaps  the  most  important  defect  of  his  work  is  his  reduction  of  sur-
,plus value and variable capital to the disposable income of capitalists and
