B.I  The real estate-and-rentals sector
The real estate-and-rentals sector consists of three basic types of
nonproduction  activities: fictitious  (imputed) rentals of owner-occupied
housing; rental and sale of land; and rentals and sales of buildings and
equipment.

NIPA accounts treat homeowners who live in their own houses as if they

"such a treatment, they create a set of fictitious rental flows. On the reve-"
"nue  side,  home  maintenance  expenditures  of  private  homeowners are"
"treated as the input costs Mir (ir stands for ""imputed rental"") of this im-"
"puted owner-occupied rental sector, to which is added a wholly  fictitious"
value added VAir (composed of fictitious wages and profits Wir + Pir). On
"the use side, all the adjustments  take place within the consumption col-"
umn. The home maintenance expenditures from  which Mir is derived are
shifted from the rows corresponding to the actual commodities purchased
