5.8  Government absorption of surplus value,
,Another  issue concerns the relation between total surplus value
and government purchases of commodities and of labor power. Govern-,
ment purchases of commodities directly absorb a portion of the surplus,
"product,  and government  administrative employment  indirectly absorbs",
another  portion  through  the  consumption  expenditures  of  the  govern-,
ment  workers  (see  Section  3.2.B).  Thus  total  government  expenditure,
G£ s  G + WG is a measure of the total absorption of the surplus product,
by  unproductive  government  expenditures.  Table  5.11 and  Figure  5.21,
show the progress of G£ and G£/SP over the postwar period. What is,
most striking here is the stability of the government share of the surplus,
"product. For most of the postwar period, this share remains around  35,",
,in  spite of  the Korean  War  buildup  from  1950 to  1953 (itself  following
upon the demobilization after World War II) and the Vietnam War build-,
up from  1965 to 1968.,
5.9  Net tax on labor and adjusted rate of surplus value,
,"As noted in Section 3.3, the nominal wages of production work-"
"ers must be adjusted  for the net transfers of royalties (ground rent, inter-",
"est, and taxes) from variable capital. We calculate only the portion of this",
arising from the net transfer between workers and the state. The method-,
ology  and  actual  estimates  are  from  Shaikh  and  Tonak  (1987)  for  the,
United  States  from  1952 to  1985.20 Our  adjustment  procedure  involves,
"two steps. First,  we estimate the social benefit  expenditures directed to-",
"ward  wage and  salary earners by the state, the taxes paid by them, and",
"the difference  between the two, which is the net transfer (a positive num-",
ber  when  benefits  exceed  taxes  and  negative  in the  opposite  case). The,
true compensation of wage and salary earners is their apparent compen-,
