Measuring  the wealth of  nations,8
Capital  finance  accounts  such  as  those  associated  with  the  United  Na-,
tions  System  of  National  Accounts  (described  hereunder)  focus  on  the,
sources  and  uses  of  funds  for  capital  transactions  (transactions  which,
"affect  stocks of financial and real assets). Flow-of-funds  (FOF) accounts,",
"which  are associated  with the U.S.  NIPA,  track the sources and uses of",
funds  for both capital transactions and current transactions (production-,
"related flows as well  as transfer  payments)  (Ruggles  1987, p.  380).  They",
"show  the financial interrelationships  among  economic  units,  and can be",
"viewed  ""as a direct  extension  of    . .  . into  the financial markets""",
"(Ruggles and Ruggles  1982, p. 10).",
,National  balance  sheets  address  the  second  limitation  of  production
accounts by linking flows to changes in stocks.9 This allows one to build,
a comprehensive  picture of  national  wealth encompassing  nonreproduc-,
"ible  assets  (land,  natural  resources),  reproducible  assets  (business fixed",
"capital and inventory stocks, stocks of consumer durables, stocks of mone-",
"tary  metals),  and  net  external  claims  on  foreign  tangible  and financial",
"assets (Goldsmith  1968, p. 52).",
,"To be fully useful,  the production, financial, and balance sheet accounts"
should  be  integrated  into  one  another.  Although  this  has  not  yet  been,
"done  for  official  U.S.  accounts,  it has been more or less accomplished in",
the  United  Nations  System  of  National  Accounts  (UN/SNA).  For  this,
"reason,  and for  the sake of  comparability  with other nations  (almost  all",
"of whom use the UN/SNA),  the United States is expected to change over",
"to the UN/SNA  by the mid-1990s (Carson and Honsa 1990, p. 20).",
,"The UN/SNA  are more comprehensive than the U.S. accounts, because"
they  constitute  an  integrated  system  that  uses  consistent  definitions  and,
"classifications to link together NIP and IO national production accounts,",
"financial accounts,  and balance  sheets.  There are also  some notable  dif-",
ferences  between  the  classification  systems  of  the  two  sets  of  accounts.,
"The  UN/SNA  focuses  on  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  not  gross  na-",
tional  product  (GNP).  GDP  measures  net  production  within  a  nation,
while GNP measures net production by nationals of  a country (including,
"those  who  live  abroad),  and  the  differences  can  be  significant  for  some",
countries. The UN/SNA  also distinguishes between government consump-,
tion  and  investment  (the  latter  being  the  change  in  nonmilitary  govern-,
ment  equipment  and structures).  Under discussion are issues  concerning,
the treatment  of  research-and-development  expenditures  and of  natural,
,resources and the environment (see the remarks on Eisner and Repetto in
"Section 1.3).  Revisions of the UN/SNA  are currently under way, but sub-",
"stantial changes are not expected  (Carson and Honsa  1990, pp. 21-30).",
