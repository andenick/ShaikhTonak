Critical  analysis  of previous  empirical  studies,203
"can possibly harbor ""unproductive"" (i.e. unnecessary) activities. The state,",
"the household,  and the noncapitalist  community become prime suspects.",
,Baran (1957) quite rightly rejects this tradition of market worship. Cap-
"italism creates and sustains many unnecessary activities, he insists, which",
absorb a significant  portion of the economic surplus. Baran (p. 9) defines,
"the surplus as ""the difference  between society's actual current output and",
"its actual current consumption,"" but Baran and Sweezy (1966, pp.  9,112)",
"later  refine  it to  be the  difference  between  ""total  social  output  [and] the",
"total  socially  necessary  costs  of  producing  it."" Under monopoly  capital-",
"ism,  they argue,  surplus tends to grow  faster  than the demand  for it,  so",
that it becomes increasingly necessary to divert the surplus into  wasteful,
"sales  efforts,  state  and  military  expenditures,  unnecessary  expenditures",
"generated by planned obsolescence,  and into external outlets in the Third",
"World  (p.  341).  In  a  more  positive  vein,  the  economic  surplus  can  be",
"viewed as a potential  fund  for socially desirable uses. Lippit (1985, p. 10)",
"argues  that  the  economic  surplus,  which  is that  part  of  national  output",
"over  and  above  ""the essential  consumption  needs,  public  as well  as pri-",
"vate,  of  all  of  its citizens,"" forms  a ""kind of  discretionary  fund  that  the",
"society may choose to utilize in a variety of  ways."" Stanfield  (1973, p. 3)",
"quotes Weisskopf  to the effect  that the economic  surplus is ""that part of",
its productive capacity that a society has some potential  freedom to allo-,
"cate among competing  alternatives.""",
,"In most discussions of the surplus, the NIPA measure of NNP is taken"
to  be an adequate  measure  of  output.  The measure of  surplus  therefore,
"depends  on  the  definition  of  the ""socially  necessary  costs"" of  producing",
"this  output.  And  here  the  market  is  no  guide,  since  it  clearly  sustains",
hugely  wasteful  expenditures.  Baran and Sweezy therefore  turn to  some,
"concept  of  a ""rational allocation"" of  resources as a guide to social neces-",
"sity. Within this rubric, unproductive labor becomes that labor for which",
"""the  demand  would  be  absent  in  a  rationally  ordered  society""  (Baran",
"1957, pp. 5,  32). Unproductive  labor is then socially unnecessary labor.",
,"In  the  appendix  to  Baran  and  Sweezy's  book,  Phillips  provides  the"
first  estimates  of  economic  surplus.  He  defines  this  as the  sum of  prop-,
"erty income, business waste, and all government expenditures (Baran and",
"Sweezy  1966,  pp.  369-70).  This  is  a  rather  eclectic  definition,  since  the",
,first two items are from the revenue side of NIPA accounts while the third
,"is from the use side. Properly speaking,  he should have included govern-"
ment  tax  revenues  rather  than  government  expenditures.  Phillips  also,
mentions that the measure of  economic  surplus also ought to contain an,
"estimate  of  that  portion  of  ""output  which  is  foregone  owing  to  the  ex-",
"istence  of  unemployment""  (p.  370),  but  he  does  not  attempt  this  him-",
,"self.  In any case, property-type income is defined  as the sum of  after-tax"
