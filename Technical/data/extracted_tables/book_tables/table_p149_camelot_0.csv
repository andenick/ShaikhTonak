,Because  the  rate  of  exploitation  of  productive  workers  is  simply  the,,,
,"rate of  surplus value, we can directly estimate the rate of exploitation  of",,,
,unproductive  workers.  We  use  the  money  rate  of  surplus  value  SVV,,,
,"since we already know that it is quite close to the value rate, as shown in",,,

"e,,= ecu/ecp",,,,
,The  detailed  calculations  are in  Appendix  I.  Figure  S.18  displays  the,,,
,basic results. The relative rates of  exploitation e u/e p depend on two sets,,,
,"of  factors: relative working times h u/h p,  which never vary by more than",,,
