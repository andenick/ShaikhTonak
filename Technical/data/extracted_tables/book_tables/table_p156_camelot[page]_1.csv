"two steps. First,  we estimate the social benefit  expenditures directed to-"
"ward  wage and  salary earners by the state, the taxes paid by them, and"
"the difference  between the two, which is the net transfer (a positive num-"
ber  when  benefits  exceed  taxes  and  negative  in the  opposite  case). The
true compensation of wage and salary earners is their apparent compen-
"sation plus the net transfer.21  The tax, benefits, and net transfer  rates are"
also calculated relative to the apparent employee compensation. The next
step is to adjust the rate of surplus value for the net transfer from variable
capital.  The  previously  derived  net  transfer  rate is applied  to  apparent
"variable capital V to estimate the net transfer  from variable capital, and"
the  resulting  sum is added  to  V and  subtracted  from  S to  obtain  the
adjusted  rate of surplus value.
It is important to note that the taxes we estimate are those flowing di-
rectly out  of  total  employee compensation  (the purchase price of  labor
