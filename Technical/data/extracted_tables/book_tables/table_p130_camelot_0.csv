Figure  5.7.  Total labor and productive  labor (thousands). Source:  Table  5.5.
Appendix  F gives the details of  the calculations.  Table 5.5  and Figure
"5.7  present the estimates for L, Lp,  Lu, and L p/L  for the years 1948-89."
Note that productive employment  rises much more slowly than total em-
"ployment,  so  that  their  ratio  in  Figure  5.9  declines  by  more  than  37"
"over the postwar period. The same trend is depicted in Figure 5.11, where"
we  see  that  the  ratio  of  unproductive  to  productive  labor  L u/L p  rises
"sharply, by almost  138, over the same period."
"Total  wages  and  variable  capital:  As  noted  earlier,  we  want  our  basic"
measure of wages to include supplements to wages such as employer con-
"tributions to social security and other pension funds,  since these are part"
of  the total  cost  of  hiring labor power.  The NIPA  measure of  employee
"compensation  (EC)  is therefore  the  appropriate  starting point,10  but  we"
"must make two adjustments to it.  First, since EC covers only  employees"
whereas total employment  L includes both employees and  self-employed
"persons,  we need to  make some estimate of  the wage equivalent  of  self-"
10  Employee compensation EC includes the salaries of corporate officers (COS) and
supplements  to  these  salaries.  Mage  (1963)  excludes  these  on  the  grounds  that
