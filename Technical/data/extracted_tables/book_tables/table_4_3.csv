simply because the calculation  procedure is inconsistent.,nan
nan,It  is easy to  see how an inconsistent  procedure  might  evolve. As indi-
"cated  in  Tables  4.1 and  4.2,  only  the  producer-price  components  enter",nan
"into the value calculations, whereas both the producer price and the trad-",nan
"ing margin enter into the money calculation. For instance, the necessary",nan
nan,"product in value terms is NP = V = A* â€¢ (CONWp)p, whereas in price terms"
it  is  NP* = CONWp = (CONWp)p + (CONWp)t.  If  one  has  not  derived,nan
"the detailed  representation  of  the money  form,  as we have attempted  to",nan
"do,  then  it is tempting to make the price form  symmetric with the value",nan

"culation  of  the  money  forms  -  in  effect,  treating  the  trade  sector  as  a",nan
"royalties  sector  on the grounds  that  both  are ""unproductive."" This  false",nan
symmetry  would  then  yield  estimated  money  magnitudes  that  would  be,nan
"smaller  than  corresponding  value ones,  even when  prices were equal  to",nan
"values.  The  procedure  would  be  inconsistent,  and  the  levels  of  money",nan
magnitudes  would  be  underestimated.  Table  4.3  illustrates  such  a  sym-,nan
"metric  -  and  hence  inconsistent  -  procedure,  using  the  (more  complex)",nan
product  side  of  the  accounts.  The  revenue  side  will  of  course  yield  the,nan
same discrepancy.,nan

each  money  magnitude  downward  (relative  to  its  correct  level)  by  the,nan
