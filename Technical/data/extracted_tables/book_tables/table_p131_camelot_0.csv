This extends the coverage of employee compensation to include the wage
equivalent  of  self-employed  persons.  We  must  now  divide  total  wages
into those  of  productive  and unproductive  workers.  Given our  previous
"data on  the  numbers  of  productive  and unproductive  workers  (Lp, Lu),"
"and on the total wage bill of  all workers (W), an estimate of the unit em-"
ployee  compensation  of  productive  workers  (ecp)  would  be sufficient  to
derive the wage bill of unproductive workers (Wp = ecp • Lp) and also that
of  unproductive  workers (Wu = W —Wp).
The  BLS  provides  data  on  the  unit  wages  of  production  workers  in
"various sectors, excluding the service sector. But unlike our desired mea-"
"sure of employee compensation, BLS wage data do not include employer"
contributions  to  social  security and other pension plans.12  It is  therefore
