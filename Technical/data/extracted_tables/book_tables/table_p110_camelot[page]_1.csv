Figure  5.1.  IO accounts and Marxian categories: Summary mapping.
relations between Marxian and orthodox categories in any one such table
were summarized  in Figure 3.11 and Table 3.12.
Figure  5.1  provides  a  condensed  version  of  this  same  mapping.  Pro-
"duction, total trade, and royalties are each aggregated into single sectors,"
so  as  to  highlight  the  structural  patterns  of  the  mapping.  Value  added
"(and hence profit) are shown as gross of depreciation, while final demand"
"(and  hence  investment)  are  shown  as  gross  of  retirements,  as  in  actual"
input-output  tables.  Intermediate inputs of  the various sectors  therefore
"do  not  include fixed capital  used up (D),  which is why we label them as"
"MJ, =  (Mp-Dp),...  rather than  M p,...  as in Figure  3.11 previously.  The"
inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) row is merged into gross value added
"(GVA), and the corresponding  IVA column into gross investment (IG)  on"
the final-demand side.1  The  cross-hatching  around  IVA indicates  that  it
is included in the Marxian measures of both gross value added GVA and
gross final product GFP.
"Finally, the total trade sector consists of private and public wholesale/"
"retail  trading  activities,  plus  an  estimate  of  the building  and  equipment"
rentals sector (see Appendix B). Distributive transport was not estimated
