the apparent  fall in Wolff's  estimates of the value rate of surplus value in,,
Table 6.1.,,
,The preceding factors appear to explain why Wolff's  estimated rates of,
,"surplus  value  are  so much  higher  than  his profit/wage  ratios,  why this",
"V +  S  «V   +  S,  which",implies  that,"(1 +  S/V) =  (1 +  S/V)  • (V/V),  where"
,S/V  = S/V  since direct price magnitudes are proportional to labor values. There-,
,fore  Wolff's  money  rate of  surplus  value differs  from  his value  rate by the ratio,
,of  the  direct  price  of  workers' consumption  V  to  its  market  price  V.  But  this,
,latter ratio is simply an index of the price-value deviation for consumption goods,
"(Wolff  1977a, pp.  144-5).",,
,"9  Wolff  normalizes  the  sum  of  prices  to  equal  the  sum  of  values,  ""values"" being",
,denned  here  as  money  prices  proportional  to  labor  values.  Thus  the  average,
value/price  ratio is 1.,,
