have  calculated  the  gross  rate  of  surplus  value  as  (GVA-WP)/WP  =  146. In-
"stead, the figure he shows is GVA/W =  187 (Varga 1964, p. 108). The estimates"

"similarly  flawed.  By the  way,  it  is interesting  to  note  that  Varga cites  (but  does"
"not explain) a ""first  calculation"" by Katz of  S/V  = 209 for  1958, which is very"
close to our own estimate of 200.

"ing from 1849 to 1938 (p. 37), the net rate based on book-value depreciation  from"
"1919 to  1939 (pp.  40, 46,  apx.  2),  and a more  precise  net  rate based  on current-"
dollar reproduction costs of fixed capital for various benchmark  years from 1880
to 1952 (pp. 47-9).
