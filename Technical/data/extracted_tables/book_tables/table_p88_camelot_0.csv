value  of  the  commodity  which  is  retained  within  the  country.  The  re-
"mainder  of  the export's final selling price (its  foreign  purchaser's price),"
"which  for the moment  is assumed to be equal to the commodity's  value,"
represents the value which is transferred  abroad.

"their country,  with the rest being captured by domestic importers, trans-"
"porters,  and traders.  The domestic 
import  price  is therefore  the  foreign"
