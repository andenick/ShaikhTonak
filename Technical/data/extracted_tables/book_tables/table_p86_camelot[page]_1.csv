tion of the national economic boundary to encompass domestic carriers.
"On this basis, we will count an import as entering the United States either"
when it is unloaded  at a U.S.  port or when it is transferred  onto a U.S.
"carrier.  Similarly,  an export will be counted as leaving the United  States"
either when it is loaded onto a foreign carrier or when it is unloaded at a
foreign port of  call.
"3.4.1  GDP,  GNP,  and the rest-of-world (ROW) accounts"
Orthodox  national  accounts distinguish between gross domestic
"product  (GDP),  which  seeks  to  measure  ""the output  of  goods  and ser-"
"vices produced by labor and property located in the United States,"" and"
"gross national product (GNP), which corresponds to ""the goods and ser-"
"vices  produced  by  U.S.  residents"" (Tice  and  Moczar  1986,  p.  28).  The"
"first measure  is based on the location,  the second  on the nationality,  of"
the corporations or persons involved.
The GNP  measure of  national product is derived from the GDP mea-
"sure by adding  the rest-of-world  (ROW)  accounts,  because  ROW flows"
are designed to represent the difference  between the two concepts of  na-
"tional product. GDP counts the wages and salaries, dividend and interest"
"earnings,  and  retained earnings  of  foreign  persons and corporations lo-"
"cated in the United States. On the other hand, it excludes the same earn-"
"ings of U.S. nationals and U.S. corporations located abroad. GNP, which"
"is structured  according to  nationality,  excludes the first set and includes"
the  second.  The  ROW  accounts  are  simply  the  difference  between  the
"second and first sets, so that adding them to GDP  produces GNP  (BEA"
"1980, pp. 29-32)."
"For our purposes, it is the GDP concept which is the relevant starting"
point. Since sectoral accounts in both NIPA and IO tables are structured
"according  to  the GDP  concept,  we can work  directly with them and ig-"
"nore the ROW accounts altogether. With this out of the way, we proceed"
to  the  analysis  of  transfers  of  value  brought  about  by  foreign  trading
"margins  on  exports  and  imports,  even  when  commodities  sell  at final"
(purchasers')  prices proportional  to values.  We then extend the analysis
"to cover purchaser price-value deviations, ending up with a general sum-"
mary of  the transfers  of  value induced  by international  trade.  This will
help us separate out domestically produced value from the realized values
that are recorded in conventional  accounts.
3.4.2  Transfers of  value in international  trade
"Within one nation, the production sector transfers  a portion of"
the value of its product to the trading sector by selling it at a (producer's)
