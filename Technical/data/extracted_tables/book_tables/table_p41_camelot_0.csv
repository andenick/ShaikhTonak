"Second, we are not attempting to demarcate between ""good"" and ""bad"""
activities. One might well argue that certain activities (e.g. nuclear weapons
"production)  are  dangerous  and  destructive  and  thus  bad,  or  that  much"
of  advertising  is manipulative  and dishonest.  These would be moral cri-
tiques.  But  such  labels  are clearly  applicable  to  both  production  activi-
ties  (nuclear  weapons)  and  nonproduction  activities  (advertising).  The
production-nonproduction  distinction  is  independent  of  our  evaluation
of  their social merit.
"Third, we are not attempting to construct a political distinction, because"
"production labor is not a designation  for the working class, nor nonpro-"
"duction labor one for the petty bourgeoisie,  as Poulantzsas  (1975) would"
"have it.1  Finally,  we will  not  equate production  activities  with  ""physical"
"goods""  nor  nonproduction  activities  with  ""services."" Such  a  conflation"
has its origins in the fact that the classical economists adopt it on practical
grounds.2  Marx  certainly  rejects  any  such  association  at  the  theoretical
"level,  and  explicitly  criticizes  Adam  Smith  for  confusing  the  ""material-"
"ization"" of  labor  in a use value  with  its  embodiment  in a physical  good"
"(Marx 1963, pp. 171-2)."
"In sum,  the  distinction  we  seek  has  nothing  to  do  with the  efficiency,"
"morality,  physicality,  or  politics  of  the  activities  involved.  With  this  in"
"mind, we can turn to the argument  itself."
2.1.2  Basic activities  of  social  reproduction
"In analyzing  the  overall  process  of  social  reproduction,  we  can"
distinguish  four major types of  social activities:
"production, 
in which  the various  objects  of  social  use  (use val-"
