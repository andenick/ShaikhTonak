ecp = Wp/Lp = average wage of productive workers;
ecu = Wu/Lu = average wage of unproductive workers.
Appendix G provides the details of the calculations. Table 5.6 and Fig-
"ures 5.8-5.11 present the estimates W, V, Wu, ecp, and ecu for the entire"
interval  1948-89. Figure  5.8  contrasts  the levels of  real variable capital
and of the total real wage bill. Their absolute growth is greater than that
of the corresponding labor totals in Figure 5.7 because the wage measures
also incorporate the effects of growing real wages. But the relative move-
"ments of wage and employment measures is virtually the same, as is evi-"
"dent in Figure 5.9. VVW declines by 34, while Lp/L  declines by 37."
Figures 5.10 and 5.11 make quite explicit that the unit wages of productive
"and unproductive workers change only slightly, whereas their relative em-"
ployments change drastically. We can therefore unambiguously conclude
that the relative decline in productive to total wages Wp/W  (= VVW) is
almost entirely due to the relative decline in productive to total employ-
ment  Lp/L.
