specific  sense that their surplus labor time is extracted under a system in,
which they are subordinate to the rule of  the capitalist class. The degree,
"of their exploitation is dependent on the rate of  surplus labor, not on the",
uses to which this surplus labor is put by their employers (cf.  Shaikh 1986;,
see also Section 2.2).,
,"Erdos defines socially necessary costs as that part of ""new value"" which"
is not used by the oppressing class or the oppressive part of the state appa-,
"ratus.  This  covers  not  only  production  activities,  but  also trade and the",
"""socially useful"" portion of  government  activities. The rest of  new value",
is  the  portion  of  the  product  implicated  in  the  oppression  of  workers,
"(Erdos 1970, pp. 371-3). One can see the family resemblance between this",
"partition  and that  originally  proposed  by Baran.  At  the empirical  level,",
Erdos  defines  new  value  as  the  (NIPA)  value  added  in  production  and,
"trade,  but  not  in  services.  Necessary  costs  are  defined  as  the  wages  of",
"production and trade workers, net of  taxes and transfers,  plus one-third",
of government wages as an estimate of the socially useful portion of gov-,
"ernment expenditures.  The political  surplus, which he calls ""surplus val-",
"ue,"" is the  rest  of  new  value.  So  defined,  his measure  of  what  might  be",
called the rate of political surplus in the United States is even smaller than,
"Stanfield's  rate of  economic  surplus:  53.1% in  1929,  and 46.2% in 1964",
"(Erdos 1970, p. 384).",
,It  should  be  evident  that  the  notion  of  economic  surplus  is very  dif-
ferent  from that of  surplus value.  Surplus value is the excess of  the total,
capitalist  product  over  the  actual  capitalist  costs  of  its production.  It is,
"specific  to  the  capitalist  mode  of  production,  and  is the  foundation  for",
"capitalist profitability.  It supports investment and capitalist consumption,",
as well  as various  forms  of  social  consumption  arising  from  circulation,
and  state  activities.  Whether  or  not  these  activities  might  be  necessary,
