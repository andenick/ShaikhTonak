"worked by productive labor Hp,  and since the value added by living (pro-",,,
,"ductive) labor (V + S) is also the labor value of  real net output (Ay-VAr),",,
,we can express the value ratio V/(V + S) as,,
,,=  (Ac-wr.Hp)/(Ay-VAr),
,,"=  (Ac/Ay)(wr/y) =  (Ac/Ay)w',",
where,,,
,"Ac ss unit labor value of  (workers') consumption goods,  and",,
,Ay s  unit labor value of  net output.,,

,tal price-value deviations (pc/Ac and py/Ac) are small or at least move in,,
,similar ways over time. Our direct comparison  of  money and value rates,,
,"of  surplus  value  (Section  5.10)  indicates  that  this  is  indeed  the  case,  so",,
,Aglietta is wrong to place so much emphasis on price-value  deviations.,,
,"Second,  an  Aglietta-type  index  w' will  reflect  the  equivalent  Marxian",,
,"value  ratio  v'  if  (Ac/Ay),  the  ratio  of  the  unit  labor  values  of  consumer",,

,"Thus,  as Aglietta  notes,  the  condition  for  w' to  reflect  the trend  of  v' is",,
,that  the  social  productivity  of  labor  in the  sectors  producing  consump-,,
