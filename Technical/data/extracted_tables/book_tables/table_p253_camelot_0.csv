A.I  Original sources,
,The Bureau  of  Economic Analysis of  the Department  of  Com-
"merce has successively published benchmark input-output  tables for 1947,",
,"1958, 1963, 1967, 1972, and 1977 (see respectively, BEA 1970, 1965,  1969,"
"1974,1979,1984). Table A.I lists industries and commodities for the 1972",
table. The 1972 BEA table consists of 85 industries with the following six,
dummy industries: (1) noncomparable imports; (2) scrap; (3) government,
industry; (4) the rest of the world; (5) the household industry; and (6) inven-,
"tory valuation adjustment. Additional rows are for value added, which is",
broken down into three components: (1) employee compensation; (2) indi-,
rect business taxes; and (3) property-type income and totals of intermediate,
inputs and total industry outputs. There are an additional nine columns,
of final demand listed in Table A.I; the units are millions of 1972 dollars.,
,Because there were few differences  between the list of industries and sec-
"tors at the 85-order aggregation level, only the 1972 table is included here.",
"However, there were some changes in industrial classification, in particular",
"for dummy industries, so the lists of industries corresponding to this order",
for the other five years are included at the end of this appendix (see the BEA,
publications for individual years). In order to facilitate comparison of the,
"original BEA tables and the present database, a mapping of the sectors from",
the 1972 85-order table with those of this database is presented in Table A.I.,
A.2  Modifications by Juillard (1988),
,The BEA tables vary with respect to the degree of detail of indus-
trial  classification  and  with  regard  to  the  treatment  of  methodological,
"problems such as imports or secondary products. For the most part, any",
given methodology  has been used twice: 1947 and  1958 are more or less,
"comparable,  so are  1963 and  1967, and  lastly  1972 and  1977. The most",
serious break with the past occurs with the publication of the 1972 study.,
Because the methodology employed  for the different  tables had changed,
"over time, a number of major changes or treatments had to be employed.",
Juillard  carried  out  this  substantial  undertaking  in  order  to  produce,
a consistent database. Only the treatment of imports for final use of pre-,
vious years could  not be updated  to the new formula  (owing to lack of,
"information),  so an intermediary  solution  had to be chosen. The neces-",
"sary transformations  concern  (1) industrial  classification,  (2) secondary",
"products, (3) treatment of imports, and (4) the industry ""eating and drink-",
"ing places."" These specific changes are summarized next.",
