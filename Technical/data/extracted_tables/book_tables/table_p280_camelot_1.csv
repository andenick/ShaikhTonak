counts.8 The resulting table is identical to Figure B.7; Table B.I  provides
an algebraic summary of  the results.
"8  Since  royalty  payments  are  transfer  payments,  it  would  be  much  more  appro-"
priate  to  record  them  in  the  value-added  row  of  the  production  and  trade  col-
umns; net payments would be positive entries and net receipts would be negative
entries. This means that the value-added row in the royalties-sector column would
contain a negative entry equal in magnitude to the sum of all the royalty payments
by the other sectors as well as positive entries for wages and profits. Gross output
of this sector would then be zero (which is correct since it is not a production sec-
"tor) and its total ""value added"" would be negative by the amount  of  Mry."
