2.2  Productive labor under capitalism
The preceding definitions of production and nonproduction labor
"are perfectly general. However, they take on additional content when they"
are  considered  in  relation  to  specific  social  relations  under  which  they
"might  be  conducted.  Broadly  speaking,  labor  might  be  conducted  for"
"direct use, for sale for  income, and for sale for profit. Each of these repre-"
sents a distinct social relation under which any given labor process is or-
ganized and developed. Only the last represents capitalistically employed
"labor, in which capitalists advance capital value as wages in order to pur-"
chase and utilize labor power for  a specified  period. It follows  from  this
that capitalistically employed labor is not only wage labor but also wage
"labor  whose labor-power  is first exchanged  against  capital  (Marx 1977,"
p. 477). This covers not only production labor but also distribution and
"social maintenance labors, insofar  as they are capitalistically organized."
Now consider each of these activities in turn. All types of  production
"create use values. Insofar  as production is organized for direct use, as in"
"household  or  community  production,  it produces  use values alone. On"
"the other  hand,  insofar  as it is organized  for  sale for  revenue (income),"
"as in petty commodity production, it produces use values that are simul-"
"taneously values (materializations of abstract labor time). Finally, insofar"
"as  production  is  for  sale  for  profit,  it  represents  capitalist  commodity"
production that produces not only use values and values but also surplus
value. This last category is represented by the unshaded sections in Figure
2.3.  It  represents  capitalistically  employed  labor  which  is also produc-
tion labor.
