,Measuring the wealth of nations,6
,1.2  Official  national accounts,
,Modern systems of national accounts are actually a set of inter-,
,related accounts that  attempt  to cover different  aspects of the  function-,
,ings of market economies. The most fundamental of these are the produc-,
,"tion accounts (national-income-and-product  and input-output accounts),",
,which attempt  to measure the creation  and  use of  new national wealth.,
,These in turn may be supplemented  by ones that track financial flows in,
,the economy (capital and flow-of-funds  accounts) or ones that link pro-,
,duction and financial flows to the corresponding stocks (national balance,
sheets).,,
,At the heart of any set of national accounts lies some common defini-,
,"tion of production activities. To construct production accounts, one must",
,"first distinguish  between  production  and  nonproduction  activities,  and",
,hence between their corresponding actual or imputed transaction  flows.4,
All  transactions  not  associated  with  production  activities  are  excluded,,
,from  the measure of national product.  Because orthodox economics de-,
,"fines  production  activities very broadly,  its definition  of  nonproduction",
,activities is correspondingly narrow -  limited to transfer  payments (such,
,"as social security, unemployment payments, etc.) and any nonmarket ac-",
tivities deemed to be socially unnecessary.,,
,Given the actual  and  imputed  transactions  that  are deemed to corre-,
,"spond to some definition of production activities, the next step is to choose",
,a particular measure of production. At the most general level is the total,
,"product,  which  is the sum of  all output  produced  in a given year. This",
,is  the  basic  measure  used  in  input-output  accounts.  It  can  in  turn  be,
,decomposed  into two elementary  components: the portion  which is the,
,equivalent of the inputs used (materials and capital depreciation) in pro-,
,"ducing  the total  product;  and  the remainder,  which is the net product.",
,It  is this  latter  component  which  is the  focus  of  national-income-and-,
product accounts.,,
,"Since for every receipt there corresponds a payment by someone, there",
,are two sets of actual or imputed money flows associated with any given,
,measure of national product: production-related  receipts of the produc-,
,"ers, which are used to measure the money value of output; and associated",
,(nontransfer)  payments representing purchases of the product by its var-,
,ious  users.5  These are the  basic elements  of  a double-entry  production,
,"4  Because national accounts are built around transactions, it is necessary to impute",
