,"social consumption.  Second,  an increase in the share of  social consump-"
"tion in net output is a decrease in the social savings rate, and this tends to",
reduce the rate of  growth of  the system (see Chapter I).7*,
28,"If we write net output as Y = C'+1,  where C'=  personal and social  consumption"
,"and I =  net investment,  then the social savings rate is s'=  ( Y - C ' ) /Y  =  1 - C ' / Y."
,An  increase in the relative share of  social  consumption  is then a decrease in the
,"social savings rate, and hence a direct reduction in the Harrodian warranted rate"
,"of  growth g* =  sVv,  where v = the ratio of  capital to normal capacity output.  In"
,a  depressive  situation  in  which  the  actual  growth  rate  is  below  the  warranted
,"rate, the two might move in opposite directions. In normal growth, however, the"
,"actual growth rate will fluctuate around the warranted rate (i.e., capacity utiliza-"
,"tion will fluctuate around normal levels), so that a decrease in the social  savings"
,rate will lower the latter by lowering the former.  See Chapter 7 for further analy-
,sis and data.
