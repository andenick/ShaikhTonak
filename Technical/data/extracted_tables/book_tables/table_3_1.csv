Noncapitalist  labor activities
"and  profits,  and  consumption  demand  were explicitly  divided  between"
workers' consumption  and  capitalist  consumption.  Conventional  tables
"lack  this  level  of  detail,  but  could  be  modified  to  incorporate  it.  The"
mapping between Marxian and IO categories is greatly enhanced by these
"adjustments. As noted earlier, Appendix A provides further  detail on the"
material developed in this chapter.
3.1  Primary flows: Production  and trade
This section will deal with primary flows only. We will begin with
"a consideration of production activities alone, and then move on to ana-"
"lyze production and trade taken together. Before we proceed, it is useful"
to recall some critical points concerning the definitions of production and
trading activities.
"Briefly, ""production"" encompasses those activities that create or trans-"
"form material objects of social use (use values). As derived in Chapter 2,"
this  definition  covers  not  only  goods  but  also  many  so-called  services
"such  as transportation,  entertainment,  lodging,  cooking,  and  so  forth."
"Moreover,  since the definition  depends on the character  of  the process,"
"not on its formal ownership, it also covers government enterprises insofar"
as they produce use values (such as electricity).
"The  definition  of  ""trade,"" on  the  other  hand,  encompasses  not  only"
wholesale /retail trade but also the rental of produced commodities such
as cars and buildings (since this is merely the piecemeal sale of the prod-
"uct's use value over its functioning  lifetime), the activities of government"
"trading enterprises, and any transportation involved in conjunction  with"
these  realization  activities.  Table  3.2  outlines  the  basic  components  of
the primary (production and trade) sectors. Further detail will be reserved
for the empirical analysis in Chapter 5.
