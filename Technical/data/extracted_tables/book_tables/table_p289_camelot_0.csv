,(3) GOgr3 = land-rent component of total rents paid. There are no direct,,
,"data  for  this component.  However, we thank  Denise McBride of the BE A",,
,for  referring  us to data on the proportion  of land costs in residential home,,
,"sales, as shown in the following  tabulation  (HUD  1979, p. 133, table 27).",,

,This  proportion  g 3  -  between  land  costs  and  total  sale price  of  new  and,,
,existing homes -  can be taken as a proxy for the ratio of land rents to total,,
,"rents,  on  the  assumption  that  building  and  land  prices  are  reflections  of",,
,their  respective rental values; g 3 = 0.2183. GOgr3 is then calculated  as the,,
,product  of  g 3  and  that  portion  of  total  rental-sector  revenue  not  previ-,,
ously captured  in GO grl  and  GO gr2:,,,
,GOgr3 -  g3 • (GOgr -  GOgrl -  GOgr2),,
,"= 0.218 • (99,015 -5,017-4,432)  =  19,551.",,
,"(4)  Combining  the  estimates  for  GO grl  and  GO gr2,  we obtain  an  esti-",,
,mate  for  GO gr and  for  our  splitting proportion  g = GO g r/GO r e:,,

,,real estate sector total revenue.,
,The  estimates  of  g  are  calculated  for  all  input-output  years.  Annual,,
,values of g are created by interpolating between input-output  benchmark,,
,"estimates, as shown in Appendix  D. These are used in Appendix E in the",,
,estimation  of  annual  series  for  primary  variables. Table B.3  summarizes,,
the procedure  for  all IO years.,,,

,The  aim  of  this  adjustment,is  to  remove  the  pass-through  cost,
ABR 3  amortization  of  buildings and equipment  rented out by the  rental,,,
,sector to others. The calculation  of ABR is explained  in what  follows;  its,,
,"use  has  already  been  treated  in  Section  B.I.  As  noted  there,  this  adjust-",,
,ment  is not  applied  to  the  input-output  tables  of  Appendix  C  owing  to,,
,"the lack of  necessary detail in the data.  However,  it is applied to the final",,
