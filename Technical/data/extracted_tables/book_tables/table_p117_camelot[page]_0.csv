"Empirical  estimates  of Marxian  categories 
97"
Table 5.3  presents the NIPA-based  estimates  for the benchmark  years
only.  Since  the  IO-based  measures  in Table  5.2  do  not  include  an ABR
"adjustment  (see Section  5.1, para.  3), our present  NIPA-based  estimates"
also omit this adjustment (although it is incorporated into the full annual
series in Table 5.4). Note that current estimates differ slightly from those in
"Table 5.2, as indicated by the ratios of NIPA-based estimates to IO-based"
ones. This is a reflection of the previously noted differences between IO and
"NIPA measures.5  It is nonetheless striking that the totals are fairly close,"
although individual components such as investment and net exports differ
"substantially.  In any case, the stability of  almost  all ratios at the bottom"
of  Table 5.3  indicates that the trends are the same in both data sets.
"Table 5.4 extends coverage to the full period 1947-87, this time with the"
ABR adjustment. The previous patterns are now fully borne out. Figures
5.3 and 5.4 compare Marxian real total product (real TP) and its ortho-
"dox equivalent  (real GNP), both derived through the GNP price  deflator"
(Table J.I). The striking thing in Figure 5.4 is that their ratio falls consis-
"tently,  except  for  a brief  reversal  from  1972 to  1977. The ratios  TPVGP"
"(Marxian  total  product  to  NIPA-based  IO  gross  product),  GFPVGNP"
"(Marxian  gross final product  to  NIPA  gross  national  product),  and the"
corresponding  net  ratio  FPVNNP  also  fall  steadily  until  1972 and  then
essentially level out.  The much larger reversal in the  total-product/GNP
"ratio  is  probably  explained  by  the  oil-price  rise  in  1973,  since  the  ratio"
of  production  inputs to  GNP  (C7GNP)  rises by 17 over this interval
while  the  ratio  of  Marxian  gross final product  to  GNP  (GFPVGNP)  is
roughly  constant.
"Figure  5.5 
looks  at  the  major  components  of 
total  value  TV  ="
"looks  at  those  of  TP,  broken  down  in  this
GOp +  GOtt;  Figure  5.6"
case  into  total  intermediate  use  M' = Mp+M(t + Mry  and  gross final use
"GFU = CON + IG + ( X - I M ) +  G  (see  Figure  5.1).  In  both  cases,"
the  respective  component  shares  are  remarkably  constant.  Throughout
"the  postwar  period,  the gross trading  margin GOtt/TV  holds  steady at"
"about 18, while the input use share M7TP holds steady at about 50"
of the total product. A similar constancy holds for the productive inputs
"share  Mp/TP  (calculated  from  Table  5.4),  which  hovers  around 43"
"throughout,  rising  slightly  during  the  oil  shock  and  then  coming  back"
"down  to  normal  levels.  In Marxian  terms,  this translates  into  the prop-"
osition  that  the  flow  of  constant  capital  used  as materials  C& = M'p is a
stable  proportion  of  total  value  TV  (=TP).  This  constant-flow/flow
"ratio  does  not  say  anything,  however,  about  the  ratio  of  fixed  constant"
