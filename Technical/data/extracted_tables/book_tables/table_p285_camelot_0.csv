to royalties sector.
In keeping with their theoretical premise that all sectors are production
"sectors,  IO  tables  treat  the  payment  of  royalties  by  households  as pur-"
chases of the royalties-sector product (recorded in the royalties row of the
"consumption column), and treat the receipt of these payments as the mea-"
sure of the gross output GOry of the royalties column. From our point of
"view, this is a spurious inflation of the measures of total gross output and"
"product,  because it double counts already recorded revenues. The Marx-"
ian measures of  total value (outlined in bold lines) and total product  (in
"dashed lines) therefore  exclude these elements, as shown in Figure B.14."
Household payments of royalties introduce a new element into our gen-
"eral patterns. When we were dealing only with production and trade, the"
Marxian measure of  value added VA* was larger than the corresponding
"orthodox  measure  VA,  because  VA* included  the  intermediate  input  of"
the trade sector  Mt  as the part of  surplus value absorbed  in the costs  of
trading  (see  Table  3.6).  The  consideration  of  business  payments  to  the
royalties sector further strengthened this inequality. The business royalty
"payments  RYp + RYt appeared  as costs  in IO-NIPA  accounts,  which ex-"
cluded them  from  the conventional  measures of  value added in the pro-
duction and trade sectors. These same payments re-appear as the receipts
"(gross  output  GOry)  of  the  royalties  sector,  but  only  a  portion  GOry â€”"
Mry = VAry enters into the value added of the royalties sector.  Mry there-
fore  disappears  from  the  orthodox  measure  of  aggregate  value  added.
"Thus,  when  we  consider  business  royalty  payments  in  addition  to  pro-"
"duction  and trade,  VA* exceeds  VA by the  amdlmt  of  Mt  plus  Mry  (see"
Table B.I).
