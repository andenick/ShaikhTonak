,All  results  will  be  summarized  both  graphically  and  algebraically.  In,
"addition, we illustrate what will become an increasingly complex mapping",,
between Marxian and IO categories by means of  a continuing  numerical,,

,stant  throughout.  Thus  a given  quantity  of  total  value  TV*  will  always,
,"be divided into the same amount  of  constant  capital C*, variable capital",
,"V*,  and  surplus  value  S*.  Similarly,  total  product  TP*  will  always  be",

,"essary  product  NP*  (consumption  of  production  workers),  and  surplus",

,"sider  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  finance,  government,  and  the  external",
,"sector,  these given amounts  of  value  and product  will be subject to pro-",
,"gressively  more  complicated  modes  of  circulation  and  distribution,  and",
,their  corresponding  forms  of  appearance  within  IO  tables  will  become,
,"more  complex.  Nonetheless,  precisely  because  we  have  the  original  nu-",
,"merical  quantities  already  in  hand,  we  can  immediately  verify  that  our",
measures of  the aggregates are correct.,,
,Sectors  (such  as production  and  wholesale /retail  trade)  which  are di-,
,rectly  involved  in  the  production  and  domestic  realization  of  the  total,
,"commodity product will be called primary  sectors. Those (such as  finance,",
,"land rental and sales, and general government) involved in the subsequent",
,recirculation  of  the value  and money  streams originating  in the primary,
,sectors  will  be  called secondary  sectors.1  Such  a distinction  is rooted  in,
,"the  Marxian  approach  to  capitalist  reproduction,  and  its  rationale  will",
,"become  evident  as  we  proceed  with  the  argument.  In what  follows,  we",
,will  begin  with  the analysis  of  the primary  sectors  and then  move  on  to,
,the various components of the secondary sectors. The sections on foreign,
,trade  and  noncapitalist  labor  activities  sectors  will  round  out  the argu-,
,"ment,  to  be  followed  by  an  overall  summary  of  the  relations  between",
,Marxian  and  orthodox  national  measures.  Table  3.1  illustrates  the  sec-,
,toral  divisions  just  outlined;  further  detail  will  be developed  in the sec-,
tions that  follow.,,
,"Finally,  it should be noted that we will conduct  our argument as if ac-",
,tual  input-output  tables  included  fixed  capital  used  up  in  intermediate,
,inputs  (as depreciation)  and in intermediate  demand  (as replacement in-,
,"vestment),  so  that  value  added  and final demand  are  net  measures.  We",
,will also proceed as if value added were explicitly divided between wages,
