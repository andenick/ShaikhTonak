22   Amsden  finds  that  the  relationship  between  rates  of  surplus  value  and  G NP  per
capita  is  actually  an  inverted-U  shape.  At  very  low  levels  of  development  both
"real  wages  and  productivity  are  very  low,  so  the  rate  of  surplus  value  is  relatively"
"low.  At 
the 
intermediate 
levels  represented  by  newly 
industrializing  and  semi-"
"industrialized  countries,  productivity  gains  race  ahead  of  wage  gains,  so 
that"
"the  rate  of  surplus  value  is  very  high.  Then,  at  the  level  of  developed  capitalist"
"countries,  real  wage  gains  begin  to  catch  up  to  productivity  gains,  so  that  the  rate"
"of  surplus  value 
is  the 
lowest.  Amsden 
(1981,  pp.  237-9)  notes  that  this  cross-"
sectional  pattern  need  not  contradict  Marx's  notion  that  the  average  rate  of  sur-
plus value  rises as capitalism  develops.  But  her  findings  are contradicted  by  Izumi
"(1983),  who  studies  the  labor  value  rate  of  surplus  value  instead  of  the  realized"
"money  rate  (as  in  Amsden).  Izumi  explains  the  difference 
in  results  by  arguing"
that  the  transfers  of  value  embodied  in  realized  rates  of  surplus  value  make  such
rates  unreliable  indicators  of  the  value  rate  of  surplus  value.  See  the  discussion
of  Izumi  at  the  end  of  Section  6.2.3.
"23   Gillman  finds  that  the  general  Marxian  rate  of  profit,  the  ratio  of  surplus  value"
"to  capital  advanced, 
is  roughly  constant  from  1920  to  1952.  But  in  terms  of  the"
portion  of  surplus  value  which  constitutes  property-type  income  to  the  capitalist
"class,  the  rate  of  profit  declines  somewhat  (Gillman  1958,  p.  97).  Of  course,  this"
is not  because  of  a rising  organic  composition  but  rather  because  of  a rising  share
"of  unproductive  expenses  and  taxes.  In  contrast  to  this,  Shaikh  (1992b)  finds  a"
