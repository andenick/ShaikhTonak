"tion of market  (producer) prices22 from  labor values is only about 12,"
and that the average deviation of the market rate of profit  from  the cor-
responding  labor  value rate of  profit  is less than  1 (and never exceeds
"3.5  in any one year). He also calculates Sraffian  prices of  production,"
and finds that  on  average  these  too  deviate  from  labor  values  by only
"15, while the corresponding ""uniform"" rate of profit  deviates from  the"
labor  value rate by less than  4  (and  never  exceeds 5)  (Shaikh 1984;
"Ochoa  1984b, pp.  128, 143, 151, 162, 214; Ochoa  1988, pp. 420-1, tables"
1-3).  Similar results have been found  by Petrovic (1987) for  Yugoslavia.
"On the basis of these results, we would expect that estimates of the value"
"rate  of  surplus  value would  be quite close to the money rate, provided"
the method  of  estimation is consistent in the sense discussed  in Section
"4.1. Following the procedure developed by Shaikh in 1975, Khanjian (1989)"
has made direct estimates of both labor value and money rates of surplus
"value. His methodology is that  outlined in Section 4.1, and his empirical"
procedures are similar to ours except for the treatment of the wage equiv-
alent  of  self-employed  persons.  We split  the income  of  unincorporated
"enterprises  into the wage equivalent  WEQ of  proprietors, partners, and"
"unpaid  family  members  and  a profit-type  return,  whereas  he implicitly"
treats the whole of unincorporated income as a profit-type return. Thus his
"measure of surplus value is larger than ours, and his measure of variable"
capital is smaller. These two effects  make his estimates of the rate of sur-
plus value roughly 20 higher than ours.
Because Khanjian's method of estimating the value rate of surplus value
"is consistent with his estimates of the money rates, the difference  between"
