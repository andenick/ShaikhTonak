Figure  B.3.  Rentals adjusted  for pass-through costs (A = 1000).
of  $1000 worth  of  computers  shows up in the production-sector  column
as the sum of costs (shown here as rental sector inputs of $400) and wages
"and profits.  In the production-sector  row,  the transaction  is recorded in"
the investment column since rental items are basically durable goods. At
"the  same  time,  the  $2000 revenue  of  the  rental  sector  would  also  be re-"
"corded,  as  a wholly  new  total  product  emanating  from  this  sector.  The"
column of the rental sector would show this amount as the sum of inter-
"mediate  inputs,  wages,  and  gross  profits,  the  latter  encompassing  two"
kinds of  depreciation: the depreciation of  buildings and equipment  used
to conduct  rental activities; and the amortization A of computers rented
out (which we assume to equal $1000) .4 The rental-sector row then shows
"the sources of  rental-sector  receipts,  which is interpreted here as the dis-"
tribution of  this sector's so-called  product to various users. Note that in
this treatment the pass-through cost A (the cost of goods resold) has been
counted  in  both  gross  output  (in  gross  profit  of  the  rental  sector)  and
gross  product  (in  production-sector  sales  to  gross  investment  IG).5  It is
precisely  this  cost  which  we  must  remove  if  we  wish  to  make  the treat-
ment of  computer rentals conform  to that of  any other trading activity.
