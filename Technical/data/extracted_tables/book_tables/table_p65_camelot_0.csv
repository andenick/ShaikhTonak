"counterparts,  at  least  at  this  level  of  abstraction.2  But  this  direct  and"
"simple  correspondence 
is  quite  deceptive. 
It  disappears  as  soon  as  we"
consider nonproduction  activities.
3.1.2  National  accounts  with production  and trade  sectors
We  now  broaden  our  inquiry  to  include  wholesale/retail  trade
(other trading activities will be considered  later).  Production and its ele-
"ments are the same as before,  but the circulation of this given total value"
and product is now explicitly mediated by trading activities.
Suppose that the previously considered output worth 2000 is now real-
"ized in two distinct steps. First, it is sold by the producing sector p to the"
"trading sector t,  for a producer's  price  of  1000.3 Second,  this very same"
product  is  then  sold  by  the  trading  sector  to  individuals  for  use  in per-
"sonal  consumption,  to  firms  for  use as materials  and fixed capital,  or is"
"retained  as unsold  goods  in inventories.4  The sum of  these  dispositions,"
"which equals the final selling price of the product, is called the purchaser's"
price  of  the product.  The  1000 difference  between the producer's  price
and  purchaser's  price  is  known  as  the  trading  margin  TM  of  the  trade
sector.5  The trading  sector thereby  converts  an aggregate product  worth
"2000 into money and unsold goods totaling 2000, keeping 1000 of the"
proceeds for itself.
The  present  two-stage  realization  process  distributes  the  previously
given total  value of  2000 in a new manner.  The intermediate  input and
wage bill of the production sector are unchanged (Mp 4- Wp = 400 + 200 =
"600),  but  since  its  total  revenue  is  now  only  1000,  its  profit  Pp  is  re-"
"duced  to  400  (from  1400).  At  the  same  time,  the  1000  which  is  lost"
to  the  producing  sector  is  captured  by  the  trading  sector  in  the  form
"of  its  trading  margin,  which  in  turn  is  allocated  among  its  own  inputs"
"Mt,  wages  Wt,  and  profits  Pt.  From  the  Marxian  point  of  view,  noth-"
"ing  has  changed  in the  production  process,  so  that  constant  capital  C,"
"variable  capital  V,  and  surplus  value  S  are  unchanged.  But  whereas"
the total surplus value S =  1400 previously accrued entirely to the pro-
"duction  sector  as  profits, 
it  is  now  divided  between  the  profits  of  the"
