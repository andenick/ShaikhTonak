Our primary database for employment  comes from NIPA.  For total em-
"ployment  L we use persons  engaged  in production  (PEP),  since this in-"
cludes  both  employees  and  self-employed  persons.  We use  BLS  data  to
calculate the ratios of  production labor to total labor in each production
"sector,  which  are  then  applied  to  relevant  NIPA  employment  totals  in"
order to split them into comparable  components.
Productive labor is the production labor employed in capitalist produc-
"tion sectors: agriculture, mining, construction, transportation and public"
"utilities,  manufacturing,  and  productive  services  (defined  as all  services"
"except business services, legal services, and private households; see Table"
E.I  for  a  full  listing  of  productive  services).  It  excludes  nonproduction
"labor  (sales etc.)  employed  in the production  sectors, as well as all labor"
in nonproduction sectors such as trade or finance. Total productive labor
is the sum of the production workers in each production sector. Total un-
productive labor is the sum of  nonproduction  workers in the production
sectors and all workers in the nonproduction  sectors.
Total employment in production nonservice sectors is directly available
from  NIPA.  But  since  we  only  count  a portion  of  the  service  sector  as
"productive,  we estimate the employment  in productive services by calcu-"
lating the ratio of  productive service sectors' GNP to total services' GNP
and  applying  that  ratio  to  the  total  employment  in  services  (Tables  E.I
"and  F.I).  Listing  the  production  sectors  as j  = 1,...,£  and  the  nonpro-"
"duction sectors asy = £+l,...,A7,  we have:"
