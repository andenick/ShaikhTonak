matrices for oil and gas exploration costs;1 and (3) modifying  employment,
,and  employee  compensation  data  so  as  to  maximize  consistency  within
the adjusted  IO tables for all benchmark years.,
,We wish  to  thank  Michel  Juillard  and  Ara  Khanjian  for  their  help with  input-
,"output  data and methodology,  and Paul  Cooney  for the preparation of  the text"
,of  Appendix  A  and  the  calculation  of  the  U.S.  summary  input-output  tables
,used in this study.
1,"In the BEA capital stock  series, oil and gas exploration costs have been included"
,as  part  of  the  capital  stock  for  the  petroleum  refining  industry.  Yet  these  same
,costs  are  included  as  intermediate  inputs  in  the  same  industry  of  the  BEA  IO
,tables. Hence one must adjust one of  the two data sets.
