"rate of surplus value, and -  upon finding that the latter is falling over the",
postwar period -  mistakenly conclude that it must be the result of a labor,
force  strong  enough  to  squeeze  profits  by  increasing  real  wages  faster,
"than productivity  (i.e.,  by reducing the rate of  exploitation  of  labor), in",
both the United States and the United Kingdom.,
,"Working  within  an  IO  framework,  Wolff  (1975,  1977a,b,  1979,  1987)"
"and  Sharpe  (1982b)  also  treat  all  labor  as productive,  thereby  implicitly",
or  explicitly  associating  the  rate  of  surplus  value  with  the  profit/wage,
"ratio.  Thus,  even though  neither  author  draws any labor-squeeze  impli-",
"cations  from  his results,  their  money  and ""labor value  estimates  of  rates",
of  surplus value suffer  from the same basic problems just  outlined.7,
,"Many  authors,  though,  do  utilize  the  distinction  between  productive"
and unproductive labor. But by far the largest portion of these do so only,
in the context  of  studying  a particular sector -  the manufacturing  sector,
"(Amsden 1981; Corey 1934; Cuneo 1978,1982; Gillman 1958; Mandel 1975;",
"Perlo 1974; Sharpe 1982a; Varga 1928,1935,1968; Varley 1938). The avail-",
ability  of  good  long-term  data on manufacturing  makes it a natural ob-,
"ject  of  study,  but it  also creates two new problems.  First of  all,  the sur-",
plus value  realized  in the manufacturing  sector  is much lower than that,
"produced  in  it,  because  of  value  transferred  out  to  the  wholesale/retail",
sector.8 Thus the NIPA-based realized rate of  surplus value in the manu-,
,"facturing  sector  is  only  about  55 % of  the  aggregate  rate,  although  the"
"trends are quite similar. Second, and quite independently, it turns out that",
there  is  a  substantial  difference  in  estimates  derived  from  census-based,
"manufacturing data and corresponding NIPA-based ones, at least for the",
"United States. This effect works in the opposite direction, and in this case",
"produces a substantial upward bias in trend (Section 6.2.1, Table 6.3, and",
,Figures 6.5 and 6.6). It follows that sectoral realized rates of surplus value
"do not,  in general,  provide good proxies for either the sectoral  or aggre-",
gate produced rates.,
,Among those who do distinguish between productive and unproductive
"labor,  a  second  set  of  authors  attempts  to  estimate  aggregate  measures",
