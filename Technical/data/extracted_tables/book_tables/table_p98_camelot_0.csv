The  previously  derived  mappings  describe  the  relation  between  input-
"output  accounts  and  the  money  value form  of  Marxian  categories,  on"
both the revenue and use sides of the accounts. We now turn to the cor-
responding calculation of the labor value form of these same categories.
"In  what  follows,  we will  outline  a  procedure first developed  in  Shaikh"
(1975) and extended and applied by Khanjian  (1989). Only the basic ele-
"ments  will be presented  here,  since a  fuller  development  is beyond  the"
scope of this book.
