,tween Marxian value added VA and orthodox value added VA. The same,
"can be said for disbursements from profit-type income (the sum of profits,",,
,"rents, interest, and taxes), though obviously aggregate profits  themselves",
,may  be  reduced  by the amount  of  royalties  paid  out  as net  interest  and,
indirect taxes.,,
,"Finally, the households,  government,  and foreigners  supported out of",
,primary-sector revenues may pay a portion (RYC + RYg + RYx_m) of their,
,"incomes over to the secondary sectors as ground rent, net interest, and so",
,"forth.  Because  such  transfers  take  place  ""downstream"" of  the  primary",
,"sectors' gross output,  value added, and profits,  the originating flows will",
,"not  be  affected.  Of  course,  the  receipt  of  these  payments  will  increase",
,"revenues of the secondary sector, and orthodox accounts will register this",
,"increased revenue as an increase in gross output.  On the use side, ortho-",
,dox  accounts  record the transfers  in question as purchases of  secondary,
,"sector  output,  to  be listed in the household-,  government-,  and  foreign-",
,sector columns of final demand; this raises the aggregate measure of final,
,"demand.  Since none of  the primary-sector measures are affected,  and all",
,"of the secondary-sector measures are raised, the aggregate orthodox mea-",
,sures are all raised relative to the corresponding  Marxian measures. The,
,same  argument  applies  to  profit-type  income  relative  to  surplus  value.,
,This  latter  result  gives  rise  to  the  possibility  that  profit  can  actually  be,
,"greater than surplus value,  owing  solely to the manner of  circulation  of",
,the product.  We will examine this new and striking result in more detail,
in Section 3.2.2.,,
,"In  summary,  royalty  flows  increase  the  orthodox  measures  of  gross",
