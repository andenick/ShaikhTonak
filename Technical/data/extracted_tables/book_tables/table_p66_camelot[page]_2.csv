"To derive the use-value  side,  we follow  our previous conventions: For"
"each  sector,  intermediate  use  of  the  product  is the  same as its  materials"
"inputs  on  the  revenue  side  (Mp = 400,  Mt = 200);  workers' consump-"
"tion is equal to their wages (CONWp = Wp =  200, CONWt = Wt = 400);"
"capitalist  consumption  is  one  half  of  sectoral  profits  (CONCP = 200,"
CONCt =  200);  and  total  investment  (including  unintended  inventory
"change) is equal in magnitude to the other half of  profits  (Ip = 200,  It ="
200).
"From a Marxian point of  view, the productive input use U,  the neces-"
"sary product  NP,  and the  surplus  product  SP  are unchanged  by their"
"more  complex  mode  of  circulation.  This  means  that  U = Mp = 400,"
"NP = CONWp =  200,  and  SP =  1400,  as before.  But  the  disposition"
"of  the  surplus  product  is now  different,  since  it is absorbed  not  only  by"
capitalist consumption and investment in the production sectors but also
by all  uses of  the trading sector.  Thus
