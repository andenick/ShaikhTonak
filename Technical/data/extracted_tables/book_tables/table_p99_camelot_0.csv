Figure 4.1.  IO accounts and Marxian categories: Condensed form.
It should be noted that Figure 4.1 collapses all the productive industries
"into one sector. For aggregate money value calculations, this is adequate"
because we are only interested in the sum of  money values. But for labor
"value calculations,  we generally need to know the individual elements  of"
the  productive  sectors.  Therefore  we may  also  think  of  the  production-
row  elements  in  Figure  4.1  as  matrices  representing  corresponding  par-
titions  of  the  matrix  pictured  in  Figure  3.11.  We  will  use  the  notation
"(Mp) p,M p,...  for the sum of  money values, and (M p) p,M p,...  to repre-"
sent corresponding  matrices.
The numerical examples in our text are constructed on the assumption
that selling (i.e. purchaser) prices are equal in magnitude to labor values.2
"Indeed, all these examples were predicated on the same physical and rev-"
enue flows: a total  product  whose labor value TV = 2000 hours and total
"selling  price  TV =  2000,  composed  of  400  in  production  inputs  (C ="
"400 hr, C = 400)  and  1600 in value added  (of  which 200 represents the"
"wages and consumption of production workers and the rest surplus value,"
"so that  V = 200 hr, V =  200 and S =  1400 hr, S =  1400). The purpose"
of  all of this was to allow us to check that the various elements add up to
"the  correct  totals,  no  matter  how  complicated  the  transfers  of  value.  It"
also ensured that  any discrepancies  that  arose between individual  Marx-
ian categories  and their orthodox  counterparts  were due solely to  differ-
"ences in their concepts,  not to price-value  deviations."
"As  noted  earlier,  for  the  money  form  of  Marxian categories, we need"
to  estimate  the  purchaser  price  of  various  commodity  bundles  because
"these  are the final selling  prices.  However,  since input-output  tables are"
