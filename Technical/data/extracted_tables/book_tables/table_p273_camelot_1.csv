Figure  B.I.  Removing  imputed rentals.
The whole procedure is meaningless  from our point of  view.  We must
therefore  exactly  reverse  the  imputations  just  described  in  order  to  re-
capture the actual flows within the real estate-and-rental  sector.  This re-
"quires two operations: In the rental-sector column, we subtract Mir from"
"the intermediate inputs,  and Wir and Pir from the corresponding compo-"
"nents  of  value  added;  in  the  consumption  column,  we  subtract  VAir ="
"Wir + Pir from  the rental row.  In principle,  we should also now shift  Mir"
from the rental row back to the various other rows that represent the ac-
tual commodities used for home maintenance. But since this would change
"only  the  distribution  of  elements  in the  consumption  column,  not  their"
"total,  and  since  the  necessary  detailed  data  are  unavailable,  we  do  not"
undertake  this  step.  Figure  B.I  summarizes  the  process  of  restoring  the
rental-sector flows to their actual levels.2
"Once  we  have  reduced  the  rental  sector  to  its  actual  rental  flows,  we"
need to separate these flows into revenues derived (1) from the rental and
"sale of buildings and equipment, and (2) from the rental and sale of land."
"The  former  is a trading  activity,  and must  be merged into the trade sec-"
"tor. The latter is a royalty payment,  and belongs under private royalties."
Building and equipment  rentals are activities in which the use value of
"a  produced good  such as a building is sold piecemeal  (""rented"")  over its"
"economic lifetime.  As such, it must be merged into the overall trade sec-"
"tor.  But in order to do so,  its row allocations  must be unbundled,  in the"
"same  way  as  those  of  wholesale/retail  trade.  To  recall  how  this  works,"
