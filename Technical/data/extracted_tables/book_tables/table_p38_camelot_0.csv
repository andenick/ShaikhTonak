"certain  critical  characteristics.  First,  they  are intended  to  be  extensions,",
"not alternatives, to the conventional accounts that form their core (Eisner",
"1988, p. 1616). Second, like the conventional accounts around which they",
,"are built, the ""theoretical constructs they are presumed to serve"" (p. 1612;"
"Repetto  1989,  p.  v)  are  those  of  neoclassical  economics.  Third,  at  the",
core  of  all  national  accounts  lie  the  production  accounts  (Carson  and,
"Honsa  1990,  pp.  28-9).  Fourth,  the  neoclassical  concept  of  production",
"embodied  in conventional  production  accounts is a very elastic one, en-",
"compassing  not  only  all  results  of  potentially  marketable  human  labor,",
"but also the ""services"" of durable goods and even the ""benefits"" of leisure",
time.  At  the other  extreme  we find the restricted  concept  of  production,
embodied  in  the  National  Material  Product  system  of  the  formerly  so-,
"cialist  bloc.  Here,  the  core  accounts  are focused  on the production  and",
distribution of  physical goods.,
,The system we develop falls between these two polar extremes. On one
"hand, our production encompasses both goods and services. Indeed, the",
vast bulk of the traditionally defined service sector falls within our defini-,
"tion  of  production  activities.  On the  other  hand,  we do  not  identify  all",
"activities as production: trading,  military,  police,  and administrative ac-",
"tivities  are treated  as  forms  of  social  consumption,  not  production.  At",
the  heart  of  the  matter  is  a distinction  between  outcomes  and  outputs.,
The  outcomes  of  nonproduction  activities  may  be  socially  desirable  re-,
"sults,  but they are not outputs.",
,Our system has its roots in the classical tradition. The classical econo-
mists were deeply concerned with the factors that regulate the growth of,
the  wealth  of  nations.  Once  it  was  recognized  that  some  activities  were,
"actually forms of  social consumption,  not production, two crucial impli-",
"cations  followed.  First,  an  increase  in  employment  need  not  signal  an",
"increase  in  production;  on  the  contrary,  it  might  signify  an  increase  in",
"social consumption.  Second,  an increase in the share of  social consump-",
"tion in net output is a decrease in the social savings rate, and this tends to",
reduce the rate of  growth of  the system (see Chapter I).7*,
