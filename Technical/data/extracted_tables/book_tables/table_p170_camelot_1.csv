"profit  fell  steadily until  1980, when the Reagan-Bush  attack  on labor ac-",
celerated the growth of the rate of surplus value and reversed the postwar,
trend  of  the  rate  of  profit  (although  it  remains  much  lower  than  at  the,
"beginning of the period). Finally, the ratio of unproductive to productive",
,"labor  L u/L p  rose  dramatically,  as  is  evident  in  Figure  5.11.  The  result-"
,ing relative absorption of  surplus value by unproductive expenses in turn
helps explain two  facts: Both the NIPA-based  average rate of  profit  and,
,the observed corporate rate of profit declined more rapidly than the Marx-
,ian  one;  and the conventional  measure  of  productivity  rises much more
,"slowly than the Marxian one,  which is an important clue to the so-called"
productivity growth slowdown of  these years.,
,All these results confirm our basic premise that the theoretical difference
,between Marxian and orthodox economic analysis is reflected in a funda-
mentally different  empirical picture of  capitalist reality.,
