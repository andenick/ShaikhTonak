,The production of data on the mass of surplus value S and profit,,,
,P  allows us then to estimate and compare three measures of the rate of,,,
,"profit:  the Marxian general rate of profit  r, defined  here as the ratio of",,,
,"surplus value to total fixed capital K;16 the average rate of profit r, defined",,,
,as the  ratio  of  profit-type  income  net  of  individual  business taxes  (P =,,,
,"P +  â€” IBT) to K; and the corporate rate of profit  rcorp, which is the ratio",,,
,of  the  NIPA  measure  of  corporate  profit  to  the  BEA  measure  of  cor-,,,
,porate capital. We also estimate the value composition of (fixed) capital,,,
,"C/V = K/V, as well as the materialized composition of (fixed) capital",,,
,"C/(V + S) = K/(V + S). All variables are in current dollars, includ-",,,
,ing the capital stock that is measured at current replacement costs.,,,
,"Finally, since we are concerned  here with the long-term tendencies of",,,
,"the rates of profit, all measured ratios are adjusted  for cyclical  fluctuations",,,
,"by means of a measure of capacity utilization developed in Shaikh (1987,",,,
,1992a). The rate of profit  may be thought of as responding to long-term,,,
,structural changes in the rate of surplus value and the organic composition,,,
,"16  More properly,  one should  add the stock  of  circulating capital (i.e.,  inventories",,,
,"of  raw materials and goods in process, which are the stock equivalents of C and",,,
,"V,  or  M and  W in the orthodox  case) to  the stock  of fixed capital.  But consis-",,,
