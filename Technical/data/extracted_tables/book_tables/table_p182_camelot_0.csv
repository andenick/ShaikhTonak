"or three times over"" (pp. 165,176, n. 66). These same points figure promi-"
"nently in our own development  of the argument.  He also excludes ""taxes"
"paid  by workers  -  as  distinct  from  deductions  for  social  security"" from"
variable capital  (pp.  176-7). This too would accord with our approach if
these taxes are interpreted as net of the corresponding social expenditures
on labor (see Section 3.3). But Mandel also argues that the costs of circu-
"lation belong ""neither to the variable capital paid out each year nor to the"
"annual quantities of surplus-value"" (p. 165), and that ""services in the real"
"sense  of  the  word  - 
i.e.,  all  except  those  producing  commodity  trans-"
"portation,  gas, electricity  and water -  do not produce commodities,  and"
"hence do not create any new value"" (p.  176). These last two  propositions"
"are  diametrically  opposed  to  our  own  approach.  Finally,  even  though"
"Mandel  is  careful  to  state  that  the  ""application  of  Marx's  categories  to"
"must  . ..  be  handled  with  extreme  caution,"" he"
"nonetheless  suggests that ""a comparison between the official  calculations"
of the share of the sum of wages and salaries and the share of the mass of
profit  in the  national  product  certainly  provides  a reliable  indication  of
"the medium-term development of the rate of surplus value, for the neces-"
sary correction of these aggregates to align themselves with Marxist cate-
gories  is  unlikely  to  alter  in  any  decisive  way  the  proportions  between
"them in these periods of  time"" (p.  166).  Sharpe (1982a,  p.  5) cites this as"
evidence  that  even  so  knowledgeable  a  writer  as  Mandel  falls  into  the
error of confusing orthodox categories with Marxian ones. But the matter
"is not  so clear-cut.  On one  hand,  in his empirical  work  Mandel  uses the"
"term ""wages and salaries"" to mean production worker wages and salaries"
"(a convention  that  originates  in  use  of  the term  ""wages"" to  mean ""pro-"
"duction  worker  wages"" in  the  Census  of  Manufactures),  and  measures"
"""profits""  as  the  excess  of  value  added14  over  production  worker  wages"
"and  salaries.  Indeed,  Mandel's  own  empirical  methodology  is an exten-"
"sion  of  that  in  Varga  (1928,  1935)  and  Gillman  (1958),  in which the dis-"
tinction  between  productive  and  unproductive  labor  plays  a  vital  role.
"On the other hand, Mandel also uses (without any methodological objec-"
