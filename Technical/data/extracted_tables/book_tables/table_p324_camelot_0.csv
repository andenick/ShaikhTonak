,Having expanded our measure of wages to encompass the wage equiva-
"lent  of  self-employed  persons,  we turn to  its  division  into  the  wages  of",
productive and unproductive workers.1 The first step is to derive an esti-,
mate  of  the  unit  employee  compensation  of  productive  workers  (ecp).,
We have:,
,"(wp)j = unit wage of production workers in they th production sector,"
,"y =  l,...,A:(fromBLS);"
,Xj B (EC/WS)y = ratio of employee compensation to wages and
,"salaries in the j th production sector, j  =  1,..., k"
,(from NIPA);
(ecp)y B (wp)y • (x7) = estimated employee compensation of  production,
,workers in they th production sector.
"For services, long-term data on wp and x were unavailable, so we assumed",
productive  workers in services had the same wage as the average service,
worker: (ecp)serv = ecserv.,
,"Given  W  and  the  various  (ecp)7  just  derived,  together  with  the  data"
,from Appendix F on the numbers of  productive and unproductive work-
"ers  (L p,L u),  we  can  derive  the  wage  bill  of  productive  workers  ( W p s",
eCp-Lp) as well  as the  wage bill  and  wage  rate of  unproductive  workers,
"(Wu =  W - W p,  ec u = W u/L u). 2  We have:",
,Wj s  (ecp)y • (Lp)y s  (Wp)y = variable capital in the j th production sector;
V* s  Wp =  S( Wp)y = total variable capital;,
Wu B W -  V* = total wages of unproductive workers in all sectors;,
ecp = Wp/Lp = average wage of productive workers;,
ecu = Wu / L u = average wage of unproductive workers.,
See Table G.2.,
,"Finally, there are two implicit aspects of our procedure upon which we"
can cast some empirical light; both relate to our use of employee compen-,
,sation  as  the  base  for  wages  and  salaries.  Employee  compensation  in-
cludes corporate officers' salaries (COS). These should be excluded  from,
"variable capital because they actually represent income of capitalists, not",
,"wages of workers (Mage 1963, pp. 188-9). Indeed, our method  effectively"
1,If  we could safely  assume that production and nonproduction  workers have the
,"same wage, then we could use the ratio L p/L  to split total wages W. But we shall"
,"see that wp is not the same as wu, which is why we adopt our own procedure."
,2  The BLS does not publish data on the wage rates of  nonproduction workers.
