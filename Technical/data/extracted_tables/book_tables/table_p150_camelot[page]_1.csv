constant-dollar total product TPr divided by the total number of produc-
"tive  worker  hours  Hp.  The  corresponding  orthodox  measure  is  y,  the"
ratio  of  constant-dollar  gross  domestic  product  GDPr divided  by total
(productive  and  unproductive)  hours  worked  Hj.  Two variants  of  the
"orthodox measure are shown: real GDP per employee hour y, and non-"
farm business real GDP per hour of persons engaged y2 (yi is the equiva-
"lent BLS measure shown in Appendix J, which is only available in index-"
"number form). Finally, because orthodox measures are always based on"
"the final product  (GDP) rather than the total product, we also calculate"
a quasi-Marxian measure y  as the ratio of real Marxian gross final prod-
uct GFPr to hours of  productive labor Hp. This has a much lower level
"than the true measure q, but has essentially the same trend. Within the"
limits of the approximation of the Marxian final product added by GDP
"(see Table 5.4), we can therefore approximate the trend of the true mea-"
sure by the ratio of real GDP to hours of productive labor  Hp:
