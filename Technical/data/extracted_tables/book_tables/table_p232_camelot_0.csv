when capacity utilization fluctuated around a normal  level).3 At normal
"capacity  utilization,  the Marxian rate of  profit  is determined  by the rate"
of surplus value and the value composition of capital. Thus the causation
in equation (3) runs from r*' to r^. It follows that the observed net rate of
profit  r'n  will  fall  relative to  the  Marxian general  rate r*' when a greater
proportion of surplus value is absorbed in business taxes or unproductive
expenses.  For this reason we label b the social  burden  rate.4
"If  we  divide  equation  (2)  through  by  K*  and  note  that  SP* = S*,  we"
find that  the  actual  rate  of  accumulation  capital  gK = In/K*  equals  the
Marxian rate of profit multiplied by the product of the social savings rate
s' (=  1 â€” c')  and the capacity utilization  rate u.  Although gK is a ratio of
"current-dollar  values,  it  may  also  be  thought  of  as  a ratio  of  constant-"
dollar  values  in  which  both  In  and  K*  are  deflated  by  the  same  price
index.  Note  that  the  social  consumption  rate  c'  represents  the  propor-
tion of the surplus product which goes to capitalist personal consumption
and unproductive  (government- and trade-sector)  use.  We then find that
the observed rate of  accumulation will fall  relative to the Marxian profit
rate when a greater portion of  surplus product is absorbed in personal or
social consumption.  We have:
