"Trade circulates use values, redistributing them from  seller to buyer in"
return  for  a counterflow  of money. Trade encompasses wholesale/retail
"trade, building and equipment rentals (piecemeal sales), distributive trans-"
"portation, and government trading enterprises. Two steps are required to"
"derive an estimate of the building and equipment rental sector. First, the"
"fictitious  components  of  the real estate and rental sector,  which consist"
of imputed wages and profits of private homeowners (who are treated as
"businesses renting their own homes to themselves), must be excised  from"
the accounts on both revenue and use sides (Section 3.1.3 and Figure 3.7).
"Second, the remaining  nonimputed  real estate and rental flows must be"
split into building and equipment rental (which is included in total trade)
and land rental and sales (which becomes a part of the royalties sector).
The value which is realized in the primary sectors can be further  recir-
culated  through  a  series  of  transfers  (which  we call  royalty  payments)
between the primary sector and various secondary sectors. These secon-
"dary flows involve the payment  of  net interest,  finance  charges, ground"
"rent, fees, royalties, and taxes. The sectors receiving these can be grouped"
"into the (private) royalties sector  (finance,  insurance, ground rent, etc.)"
and the general government sector. The two are treated as separate parts
of the royalties sector.
Because the original sources of the revenues of the secondary sectors are
"already counted in the revenues of the primary sectors, we cannot count"
them again in the measure of the total product and its total value. Secon-
"dary flows are part of total transactions, but not part of total product. In"
