The general  rate of  profit  r*'  is the common  (and principal) determi-
nant  of  both  r'n  and  gK.  We saw in Section  5.5 that  we can  decompose
its  movements  into  those  arising  from  the  rate  of  surplus  value S*/V*
and  the value composition  of  capital  C*/V*  (adjusted  for  variations in
"capacity  utilization  so as to  bring  out  the  structural,  as opposed  to cy-"
"clical,  pattern).  We then  found  that  the  data  partition  into  two  major"
"phases.  From  1948 to  1980, the  rate  of  surplus  value rises modestly by"
"roughly  22%, while the  adjusted  value  composition  rises by over 77%"
(and  the  adjusted  materialized  composition  C*/(V* + S*)  rises  by over
56%). The rising value composition overwhelms the rising rate of surplus
"value, so that the adjusted  Marxian rate of profit  falls by almost a third"
over this period.  This is striking empirical support  for  Marx's theory of
the  falling  rate  of  profit.  More  detailed  analysis  is presented  in  Shaikh
"(1987, 1992b)."
"The second period, from 1980 to 1989, spans the Reagan-Bush era, dur-"
ing which the capitalist class and the state collaborated in attacking work-
ers' living standards and labor conditions. The rise in the rate of  surplus
"accelerates in this period,  more than  doubling its trend rate.  Moreover,"
the growth in the value and materialized  compositions decelerate in this
"period,  because the low rate of profit  and slow accumulation inhibit the"
"adoption  of  new, more capital-intensive technologies. The overall  effect"
"is to  modestly  reverse  the  fall  in  the  general  rate  of  profit,  recovering"
about  8% of its initial value (see Table 5.8 and Figures 5.16 and 5.17).
We saw previously that the ratio of unproductive activities rises sharply
"over the postwar  period  (Section  5.3, Figure 5.11). Figure 7.1 shows the"
corresponding rise of  16% in the social burden rate over the postwar pe-
"riod.  Figure 7.2 shows that,  as a result,  the (net  of  profit  taxes) NIPA-"
