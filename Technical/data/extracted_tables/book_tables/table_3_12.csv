(necessity  being  equivalent  to  marketability)  is productive.  But  here the,nan
"argument  veers  too  far  in  the  opposite  direction,  since  it  obliterates  all",nan
"distinction between capitalist and noncapitalist  production,  and between",nan
production and social consumption  (Section 2.3). The whole purpose of,nan
"this  book  has been to  show  that  the  middle  road  is truly different,  both",nan
theoretically and empirically.,nan
nan,The  precise  mapping  between  orthodox  categories  and  Marxian  ones
"raises a host of  other issues. The primary sectors, production and trade,",nan
are directly involved in the production and circulation of the total product.,nan
"As  such,  their  combined  revenue  represents  the  total  price  of  the  total",nan
product. But the value which is realized in the primary sectors is partially,nan
recirculated through a series of transfers between it and various secondary,nan
"sectors, involving payments of  net interest, finance charges, ground rent,",nan
"fees,  royalties,  and taxes.  The sectors  receiving these were grouped  into",nan
"the  (private)  royalties  sector  (finance,  insurance,  ground rent,  etc.), and",nan
the general government sector (government enterprises are treated as part,nan
"of  other sectors, according to the activity in which they engage).",nan
nan,Since the original  sources of  the revenues of  the secondary sectors are
"already counted in the revenues of  the primary sectors, we cannot  count",nan
them again in the measure of the total product and its total value. Secon-,nan
"dary flows are part of total transactions, but not part of value of the total",nan
"product.  Within  IO  accounts,  this  means  leaving  out  the  columns  and",nan
nan,"rows of both the (private) royalties sectors and the ""government industry"""
dummy  sector.  These adjustments  ultimately  account  for the major  dif-,nan
ferences between Marxian and conventional  categories.,nan
nan,It should be noted that such exclusions do not mean that we ignore the
actual use of the product by the royalties sector or the actual consumption,nan
of  its  workers  and  capitalists.  Royalties  payments  are  deductions  from,nan
the purchasing power of the primary sector and its associated households;,nan
their receipt by the secondary sector enhances purchasing power and that,nan
"of  its associated  households.  What the former  set loses, the latter gains.",nan
In this  way  the  redistribution  of  value  brought  about  through  transfers,nan
between the primary and secondary sectors leads to a changed use of the,nan
nan,product.  Thus the product  use induced  by the royalties  sector  shows up
"in the intermediate  use of  the total  product,  in the government-use  por-",nan
"tion  of  final  demand,  and  in  its workers' and capitalists' portion  of  the",nan
"personal  consumption  column of final demand  (Section  3.6,  Figure 3.11,",nan
Table 3.12).,nan
nan,"Foreign trade introduces a further instance of  transfers  of  value,  since"
nan,the  value  realized  within  the  primary  sectors  reflects  not  only  the  value
nan,produced  within the country  but also  any (negative or positive)  interna-
nan,tional transfers  of  value. We must therefore  adjust  for these transfers in
