GNP is derived by adjusting actual GNP  for fluctuations in capacity uti-,
"lization,  which  is  then  reduced  to  its  production-cost  equivalent  (1973,",
pp.  78-81).  The  market  price  of  total  essential  consumption  is  similarly,
reduced.64 It consists of the sum of two items: personal essential consump-,
"tion,  defined  as the expenditure necessary to maintain the whole popula-",
"tion at the ""modest but adequate"" level represented by the ""City Workers'",
"Family  Budget"" which he takes froqi  the BLS  (1973, pp.  13, 27-35); and",
"social  essential  consumption,  defined  as  the  sum  of  social  overhead",
"consumption  (government  administration,  international  affairs,  civilian",
"safety,  sanitation,  postal,  etc.), some essential  fraction of  health, educa-",
"tion,  transportation  and public utilities  (Stanfield  1973, pp.  39-40),  and",
"the replacement-cost  depreciation on the capital stock  (pp. 22-4, 46). 65",
,Stanfield's  methodology  produces  measures  of  constant-dollar  poten-
"tial and actual economic  surplus, valued at production costs.  In order to",
"facilitate  comparisons,  we  have  restated  the  constant-dollar  actual  eco-",
nomic  surplus  in  market  prices  by  reversing  Stanfield's  own  procedure.,
Table 6.11 and Figures 6.10 and 6.11 compare the economic surplus mea-,
"sures from Phillips and Stanfield with our measure of surplus value, all in",
constant  (1982)  dollars.  Figure  6.11  compares  our  real  rate  of  surplus,
"value with what might be called the real rate of economic surplus, defined",
"as the ratio  of  economic  surplus to  essential  consumption,  in  Stanfield's",
"data. As anticipated, Phillips's measure of economic surplus is much closer",
"to  surplus value than  is Stanfield's.  Moreover,  the  Stanfield  rate of  eco-",
"nomic  surplus  not  only  is half  of  the  rate of  surplus value,  but  also be-",
haves quite differently  over time.,
,"Finally, Erdos (1970) provides an eclectic variation on these themes. His"
"measure is a kind of  ""political"" economic surplus, even though he labels",
it as (redefined)  surplus value. His stated intention is to modernize Marx-,
"ian categories  by making  them ""correspond  as exactly as possible to the",
,"empirical facts of our days."" But what he actually does is conflate the rate"
"of surplus value with the rate of exploitation, and the concept of exploita-",
"tion  with  the  concept  of  oppression.  From  our  point  of  view,  Marxian",
"surplus  value  is  the  surplus  labor  time  of  productive  workers,  because",
only they produce a capitalist surplus product.  Some of this goes to sup-,
"port  unproductive  workers.  Both  sets  of  workers  are  exploited,  in  the",
