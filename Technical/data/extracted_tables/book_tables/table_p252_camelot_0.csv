The  primary  database  from  which  the  condensed  tables  in  Section  5.1
and Appendix C are derived is composed of input-output tables that cor-
"respond  to  the  85-industry  IO  tables,  in  that  the  final  versions  have  82"
rows and 88 columns. All the input-output  tables used are originally de-
rived  from the benchmark  tables produced by the BE A  (Bureau of  Eco-
"nomic Analysis), which is part of the U.S.  Department of  Commerce.  In"
an effort  to improve the compatibility  of  the data for different  years and
"from  different  sources,  various adjustments  and modifications  were car-"
"ried out on the data series used. Most significantly,  Juillard (1988) carried"
out  several adjustments  on the input-output  tables so as to have as con-
sistent  a  methodology  as  possible  for  all  the  benchmark  years.  Several
additional adjustments and aggregations were conducted in order to ren-
"der  data  sets  from  different  sources  more  consistent.  Among  these,  the"
major adjustments were: (1) reversing the methodology of  force  account
construction used with the BEA IO tables; (2) adjusting the BLS (Bureau
"of  Labor Statistics, Department of  Labor) capital stock and depreciation"
matrices for oil and gas exploration costs;1 and (3) modifying  employment
and  employee  compensation  data  so  as  to  maximize  consistency  within
the adjusted  IO tables for all benchmark years.
