"argues against this procedure on both theoretical  and practical grounds,",
noting in passing that if revaluations were counted as part of income and,
"output  flows  then  one  would  have  to  conclude  ""that  the  U.S.  national",

"shift  police, fire protection,  defense,  and  guard  activities  from  the final",
"product  to  intermediate  input;  NT  directly  subtract  other  ""regrettables",
"and disamenities.""23  Both procedures serve to lower the measure of final",
product.,
,Figure  1.1 presents  the  various  estimates  of  gross final product  which
"flow from  the six conventional  extended accounts, relative to the  official",
"BEA  measure  of  GNP,  as  summarized  by  Eisner  (1988,  p.  1673,  table",
"S.5) for the mid-1960s. Also included are our own estimates, as developed",
in subsequent  chapters of  this  book.,
,"Two things are notable in Figure 1.1. First, all the estimates,  including"
"our own (ST), are larger than the official  measure of GNP.  In the case of",
"the six conventional  extended  accounts, this is due to the fact that virtu-",
ally  all  authors  include  estimates  of  the value  of  housework  and  of  the,
"""services"" of  household  and  government  durable  goods,  and  that  most",
also include quite large estimates for the value of leisure. As for our own,
"estimates, we find that our basic estimate of market production is smaller",
than GNP. But when we supplement this with Eisner's estimate of house-,
"work,  in order  to  make  the coverage  somewhat  similar to  that  of  other",
"extended accounts,24 the resulting figure is about  21%  larger than GNP.",
,The second  striking  feature  of  the estimates in Figure 1.1 is their great
