"Figure  6.7.  Rates  of  surplus  value:  Mage,  Shaikh,  Shaikh  and  Tonak."
"Sources:  Mage (1963); Shaikh  (1978b); Shaikh and Tonak,  Table  H.I."
data  indicates  that  its  inclusion  would  have  raised  his  estimate  of  sur-
"plus value by over 20 in 1958.40 Finally,  like Mage,  Shaikh covers only"
the  private  nonfarm  economy  (whereas  we include  both  agriculture  and
primary-sector  government  enterprises);  restricts  the  definition  of  trade
to the wholesale/retail  sector (whereas we count building rentals as trad-
ing activities); and  forgets  to put the wage equivalent  of  proprietors and
partners into total wages after he subtracts it from unincorporated income
to get  profits  of  unincorporated  enterprises. All  four  factors  work to re-
duce his estimate of  surplus value to a level considerably below ours. The
second  factor  (exclusion  of  agriculture  and government  enterprises)  and
particularly the fourth (exclusion of the wage equivalent from total wages)
also  serve  to  reduce  his  estimate  of  variable  capital  relative  to  ours.41
The net result is that Shaikh's 1978 estimates are considerably higher than
"Mage's, but still lower than ours; see Figure 6.7."
