,Eaton's  (1963)  sophisticated  treatment  distinguishes  between  produc-
"tive and unproductive  sectors,  keeps track of  the value transferred  from",
"the former to the trade sector, and even proposes that variable capital be",
adjusted  for the net tax on labor. Mage (1963) raises the discussion to an,
"entirely new level. He attempts to keep track of total value flows, at least",
"at  a conceptual  level,  by defining  it  as the sum of  the materials  costs  of",
the production sectors; variable capital (the wages of production workers,
within the productive sectors); profits; net rents paid and net interest paid,
of  production  and trade sectors; indirect business taxes paid by the pro-,
duction and trade sectors; and the wage and materials costs of unproduc-,
"tive sectors. But since he relegates the latter two items to constant capital,",
Mage  effectively  reduces  his  measure  of  surplus  value  to  just  that  part,
"which  shows  up  as  profit-type  income.  This,  and  other  more  concrete",
"considerations,  lead to  a measure  of  surplus value which is much  lower",
"than ours and which, unlike ours, falls over the postwar period.",
,Shaikh  (1978b) provides the first systematic  framework  for  measuring
the rate of  surplus value in money form.  He derives a complete mapping,
"between  Marxian  and  NIPA  categories,  on  the  revenue  side  of  the  ac-",
"counts, and shows that the rate of surplus value rises while the profit/wage",
ratio falls. He also provides the first systematic estimates of the net effects,
of  state taxation and social expenditures on the wage rate and the rate of,
surplus value.  But even though  his  framework  is essentially  the same as,
"our present one, his empirical estimates of the rate of  surplus are smaller",
because (in the absence of input-output data) he is unable to estimate the,
"size  of  the  intermediate  inputs  of  the  trade  sector,  and  because  of  sev-",
,"eral other  specific  factors.  Moseley  (1982,  1985) and Tonak  (1984) adopt"
"Shaikh's  framework,  but  in  an  approximate  form  with  some  different",
assumptions.  Tonak also extends Shaikh's sample calculations of the net,
"tax on labor to the entire postwar period, by developing a widely adopted",
"""labor-share"" method  for  splitting  tax receipts  and social  benefit  expen-",
ditures.9  Our  present  estimates  are  based  on  a  further  development  of,
,"Tonak's work by Shaikh and Tonak (1987). Finally, Papadimitriou (1988)"
,"and  Tsaliki  and  Tsoulfidis  (1988)  apply  our  present  schema,  subject  to"
"data  limitations,  to  the case  of  Greece,  and find that  from  1960 to  1977",
the rate of  surplus value rises (Section  6.2.2).,
