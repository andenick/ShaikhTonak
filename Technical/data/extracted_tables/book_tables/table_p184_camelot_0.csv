"expenditures, then the net tax is essentially small and Aglietta's measure",
"is more accurate; on the other  hand,  if  one believes that  workers' taxes",
"are used to subsidize the capitalist  class and related  state activities, then",
"the net tax is essentially equal to taxes paid, and Perlo's measure is more",
"appropriate. It is interesting to note that, for the United States, our esti-",
mates of the social wage indicate that  Aglietta's assumption  is closer to,
the mark.19,
"Cuneo (1978,1982) applies Varga's methodology to the  manufacturing",
industry  in  Canada  from  1917 to  1978. He provides  twelve measures in,
"all,  of  which  three  are  relevant  here:  RSV^  which  is just  a  Varga-type",
measure of the gross rate of surplus value for  Canadian  manufacturing;,
"RSV3,  which  is the  constant-dollar  gross rate  of  surplus value, derived",
by deflating  value added  by the  Wholesale  Price  Index and  production,
"worker  wages  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index;  and  RSV12,  which  is the",
constant-dollar  net rate of  surplus value derived by subtracting  an esti-,
"mate of depreciation from gross surplus value (Cuneo 1978,  p. 290; 1982,",
"pp.  399,415). He finds that over the postwar period these rates of surplus",
"value rise until the mid-1960s, and then fall  afterward  (1978, pp. 292-3;",
"1982,  p. 399). Cuneo also provides nine other variants of these rates, but",
"they are all linked to a rather flawed ""adjustment""  he makes to the basic",
measure RSVls for which he was severely criticized by Van Den Berg and,
Smith (1982) and Emerson and Rowe (1982).20,
Amsden (1981) applies Varga's methodology to the world economy by,
estimating  realized  rates  of  gross  surplus  value in manufacturing  for  a,
large set of  countries21  for  the period  1966-77. Her actual estimates  for,
"U.S.  manufacturing are the same as in Mandel, Perlo, and Shaikh. She is",
careful  to  note  that  price-value  deviations  and  intersectoral  and  inter-,
national  transfers  of  value may make realized  sectoral  rates  of  surplus,
