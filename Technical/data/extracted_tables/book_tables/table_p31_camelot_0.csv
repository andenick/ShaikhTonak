not  enter into  the  net  product.  It is interesting  to  note that  Mage (1963;,
p.  66) adopts a similar approach.11,
,We would  also  view  these  activities  as costs  of  maintaining  the  social
fabric.  But we treat them as nonproduction activities instead of  as inter-,
mediate inputs into production. How then would one decide between the,
"two approaches? To begin with, we note that the normal definition  of an",
input  into  production  is  something  that  enters directly into the produc-,
"tion process,  such as steel  into the production  of  an automobile.  In this",
"sense,  an activity  such  as national  defense would  surely not qualify  as a",
production  input.,
,The  other  possibility  is  to  view  national  defense  as  an  indirect  input
"into the total product, on the grounds that it serves to maintain the social",
fabric.  But to say that something is an indirect input is only to claim that,
it  is  a  necessary  part  of  the  overall  process  of  social  reproduction:  by,
"serving  to  maintain  the  social  fabric,  national  defense  constitutes  what",
"Kuznets  calls  a  ""precondition"" for  other  social  activities.  This does  not",
"imply, we would argue, that it is thereby an input into production. First of",
"all, national defense is just as much a precondition for personal consump-",
,"tion as it is for  production.  To put it the other way, it is just as little an"
"input  into  production  as  it  is  into  personal  consumption.  Second,  once",
"we introduce the notion  of  preconditions,  personal  consumption  is even",
more important than national defense as a precondition of  production.12,
Is personal consumption then also to be treated as an intermediate input,
into production?13 To answer in the affirmative  would vitiate the very dis-,
"tinction  between  consumption  and production.  Conversely,  if  we are to",
maintain this distinction then we must be able to say that production and,
"consumption have different  (albeit necessary) outcomes, and that the out-",
"come  of  consumption  is not  an output.  In this same sense,  the  outcome",
of  national  defense  is  not  an  output  either.  This  is  why  we  argue  that,
"national  defense,  like  personal  consumption,  is  a  nonproduction  activ-",
"ity.14  And  since,  like  consumption,  it  uses  up  resources  in  pursuit  of  a",
"nonproduction goal,  we label it as a form of  social  consumption.",
