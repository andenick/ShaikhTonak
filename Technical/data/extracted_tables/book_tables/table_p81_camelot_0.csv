only one entry (WG) under the government column (representing the gov-
"ernment's  purchase  of  the  government  industry's  net  product),  and  its"
column  contains  only  one  element  (WG)  in  its  value-added  row  (repre-
"senting the value added of the government industry). Through this device,"
orthodox measures of  gross and net product are each expanded by WG.
"From our point  of  view, the payments made by businesses and house-"
holds to general government  are simply a form  of  royalty payments.  As
"such, the basic principles governing the treatment of  royalties also apply"
"here. Thus, since the accounts of primary sectors already include the orig-"
"inal  sources  of  government  receipts,  we  cannot  now  count  them  twice."
"In our view,  neither government  commodity purchases G' nor purchases"
of  labor power WG enter into a production activity; we must exclude not
only the former (as IO-NIPA accounts do) but also the latter (which they
"do  not).  As  indicated  in  Figure  3.10,  this  means  excluding  the  dummy"
government  industry  from  aggregate  measures  of  output  and  product.
"As before, the basic Marxian measures are contained within the primary-"
sector blocks.
Note that exclusion of the government dummy industry does not imply
that we ignore either the government use of actual product (which shows
up  in  the  government  final-demand  column  of  the  production  row)  or
the  personal  consumption  of  government  workers  (which  shows  up  in
the  consumption  column  of  the  production  row).  Both  of  these  items
