"as his illustrative example), which allows him to make the two sets of ac-",
"counts  symmetric  -  this  time  on  both  product  and  revenue  sides  (1987,",
pp.  69-83). Thus his estimates of the money rate of surplus value continue,
"to  be  inconsistent  with  his  labor  value  measures.  Interestingly  enough,",
even though he devotes a considerable part of  his book to the techniques,
"for measuring the rates of  exploitation  and rates of  surplus value,  Wolff",
"presents no direct estimates of either (Khanjian 1988, p. 120).58 However,",
"his estimates  of  both  are implicit  in other  data that  he presents,  and we",
will examine them shortly.,
There  are  two  other  striking  problems  with  Wolff's  measurement  of,
"the rate of  surplus value.  First of  all,  in his calculation of  the net tax on",
"wages,  he  treats  (the  producer-price  component)  of  all  government  ex-",
"penditures  as  a benefit  to  consumers.  Expenditures  on  defense,  interna-",
"tional  affairs,  space programs,  and so  forth  are thereby treated as direct",
"consumer benefits  (1987, p. 78), which overstates the benefits  received by",
workers. This treatment  of  government  spending is essentially  neoclassi-,
"cal, and is greatly at odds with the one we adopt (see Section 5.9). On the",
"other  hand,  the taxes paid by workers  are understated  by Wolff  because",
he  only  counts  personal  income  taxes  (net  of  direct  transfers)  but  not,
the  portion  of  taxes  paid  for  social  security.59  The  end  result  is that  his,
method  overstates  the  measure  of  variable  capital.  Other  things  being,
"equal,  we  would  expect  the  estimates  of  the  rate of  surplus  value  in his",
,book to be even lower than those in his 1977 paper. We will see that this is
indeed the case.,
,The  second  problem  arises  in  Wolff's  attempt  to  distinguish  the  rate
of  exploitation  from the rate of  surplus value.  He introduces  a valuable,
method for calculating the average rate of exploitation of  all (productive,
"and unproductive)  workers (1987, p.  84). Using our notation,  let",
