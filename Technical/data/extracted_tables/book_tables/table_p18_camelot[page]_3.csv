5.6  Rates of  exploitation of  productive and unproductive workers
The rate of exploitation is the ratio of surplus labor time to nec-
essary labor time. This can be calculated for any capitalistically employed
"wage  labor,  be  it  productive  or  unproductive.  Necessary  labor  time  is"
"simply the value of the labor power involved, that is, the labor value of"
the average annual consumption per worker in the activities in question.
Surplus labor time is excess of working time over necessary labor time. In
"the case of  productive workers, their rate of exploitation is also the rate"
"of surplus value, since their surplus labor time results in surplus value."
The first step is to calculate the relative rates of exploitation of unpro-
"ductive and productive labor, in the manner derived in Section 4.2:"
