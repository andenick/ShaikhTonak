Marxian  general  rate of  profit.6  (Data  for  Figures 7.1 and  7.2 are  from,
Table 7.1.) This serves to emphasize that the social savings rate s' is de-,
"pendent  not  merely on the decisions of firm and households to save, as",
"orthodox  theory  would  have it,  but  also on  the  decisions  of firms and",
governments to engage in nonproduction activities.,

,The distinction between productive and unproductive labor has
other implications as well. We saw in Chapter 2 that the standard of living,
"of  workers  can  be decomposed  into  a valorized  portion,  comprised  of",
"commodities, and a nonvalorized portion, comprised of direct-use values.",
"Marx  focuses  on the  former,  since it  is the portion  that  has to be pur-",
chased by workers which in turn regulates the price capitalists must pay,
for labor power. It is for this reason that Marx defines the value of labor,
power as the value of the commodities that enter into the workers' stan-,
dard of living. But the nonvalorized portion of workers' standard of liv-,
"ing is the product of some combination of household labor, village labor,",
and  farm  labor.  And  although  this  portion  is  of  no  direct  moment  to,
"capitalists,  since they  do  not  have  to  pay  for  it,  it  can  nonetheless  be",
crucial  to  workers.  Thus  it  is  entirely  possible  for  workers  to  become,
more expensive to capitalists (if the value of their valorized portion rises),
while  still  becoming  poorer  overall  (if  their  overall  standard  of  living,
falls); see Section 2.2.,
,The classical and Marxian frameworks make a distinction between profit
arising  from  the  production  of  a capitalistic  surplus  (profit  on  surplus,
value) and that arising from transfers of wealth and value (profit on alien-,
ation); aggregate profit encompasses both (Section 2.4). A striking example,
"of this is provided in Chapter  3, where it is shown that aggregate  profit-",
type income can exceed aggregate surplus value even within the confines,
of  a single capitalist  economy  (Section  3.2.2).  Something of  this sort is,
also involved in the famous puzzles generated by the so-called  transfor-,
"mation  problem  (Shaikh  1984, 1992). A lesson here is that  even unpro-",
"ductive labor may increase aggregate profit  (but not aggregate value), to",
the extent that it is able to effect  a transfer  into the circuit of capital  from,
a noncapital circuit or noncapitalist sphere of activity.,
,"In all of these instances, the central point has been that it is insufficient"
to view unproductive labor merely as labor which is unproductive of sur-,
plus value. Each type of unproductive labor has its own effects and place,
"in reproduction.  Indeed,  it is precisely this recognition  which  orthodox",
economics turns into a justification  for the notion that all necessary labor,
