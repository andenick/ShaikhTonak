,T =  d x.X-d i m.IM.
,The last expression  is the most  convenient  one  for  the empirical  estima-
tion of  net transfers.  Note that if  trade is balanced  (X =  IM) then the,
17,"In actual  practice,  NIPA  measures differ  slightly  from  the domestic  export  and"
,import  prices  defined  here.  Exports  are  valued  in  orthodox  accounts  at  their
,"domestic  port  price alone,  which  makes their valuation  smaller than our  defini-"
,tion  of  the domestic  export  price by the cost  of  their shipping  on domestic car-
,"riers. On the other hand, noncomparable imports are similarly undervalued rela-"
,"tive  to  our  measure,  since  orthodox  accounts  leave  out  the cost  of  shipping  by"
,foreign carriers. The net difference  between the orthodox trade balance measure
,(X -  IM) and our measure of net realized trade balance (X -  IM) is quite small;
,we therefore ignore it in what  follows.
