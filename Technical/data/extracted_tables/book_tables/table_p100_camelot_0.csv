"constructed in terms of producer prices, this means that we must take the",
sum of the producer price and the trading margin of the commodity bundle,
in question. Thus the purchaser price of productive inputs Mp = (Mp)p +,
"(Mp)t.  Similarly, the purchaser  price of the total product  (the total sum",
"of prices) is TP = GOp + GOt - that is, the sum of the producer price of",
productive  sectors GOP and the total revenue of the trading sector GOt,
(which is the trading margin on the total output).,
It is important to note that while there is enough information  in stan-,
dard  (i.e. producer-price) input-output  tables to calculate the purchaser,
"price of aggregate inputs, outputs, and final demand components, there",
is not enough to calculate the purchaser price of individual commodities.,
"For instance, theyth column of an input-output matrix lists the producer",
"price  of  various  individual  intermediate  inputs  /y,  but  only  lists",
their  combined  trade  margin  y  in that  trade  row  of  that  column.,
"Similarly, the gross outputs y of various productive sectors are the",
"producer  prices of  their  products, while the gross output  of the trading",
sector GOt is the combined trading margin on all productive sector out-,
"puts.  Because the trade margins are always combined  ones, we lack the",
information  required to estimate individual purchaser prices.,
"For labor value measures, we need to calculate the labor value of var-",
ious commodity bundles. Since individual commodities in actual  input-,
"output  tables  are listed in producer  prices, we can calculate their  labor",
values  by  multiplying  the yth  commodity  by  its  labor-value/producer-,
"price ratio A. The first task,  then,  is to calculate these As. The second",
step is to apply these solely to the producer price components of various,
commodity  flows.,
If input-output tables recorded actual quantity flows (rather than money,
,"flows),  we could calculate labor values Ay by adding the hours of produc-"
tive labor3  worked  to the labor  value of  the inputs used in  production.,
"For the production sector j,   let:",
Ay = labor value per unit  output;,
