1.3  Extended national accounts for the United States,
,"Although  the various official  U.S. accounts  are not  integrated,"
much work has been done by individual researchers on linking production,
,"flows  with balance-sheet  stocks, and on expanding the coverage of pro-"
duction accounts themselves to encompass both nonmarket and nonlegal,
"activities. In addition,  there has been considerable discussion of a more",
adequate treatment of natural resources and environmental issues.,
,"Ruggles  and  Ruggles  (1982, pp.  1, 17) attempt  to  extend  U.S. NIPA"
by improving their treatment  of various individual items and by linking,
"stocks and flows. In the  former  domain, they split both  household  and",
government  expenditures  into  current  and  capital  components  (capital,
expenditures  being defined  as the net  acquisition  of  durable  equipment,
"and structures), list imputed values in separate accounts, and attempt to",
"allocate transactions in a more accurate way (e.g., owner-occupied hous-",
ing expenses are allocated to the household sector rather than to unincor-,
porated business enterprises).10 But their main concern is to integrate stock,
and flow accounts in such a way as to link up with already existing capital,
"stock  estimates  of  the  Bureau  of  Economic Analysis  (BEA), which are",
"now broadened to include stocks of household and government durables,",
and  the financial flow-of-funds accounts of the Federal  Reserve Board.,
They  end  up  with  larger  measures  of  NNP  (net  national  product)  and,
"GNP, because they add in ""net imputed income from consumer durables""",
"(which increases both NNP and GNP) and imputed ""depreciation allow-",
"ances"" on  consumer  and  government  durables  (which  increases  GNP).",
They also obtain  a much larger estimate of  national savings and invest-,
"ment,  because  they  count  changes  in the  stocks  of  consumer  and  gov-",
ernment  durables  as part  of  savings and  investment.  This is a common,
"feature  of all extended accounts, as we shall see. Denison (1982, pp. 60,",
"62-3) argues against  such procedures, on the grounds that the resulting",
"adjusted  measures  of  GNP,  NNP,  and  national  savings are less mean-",
ingful  than the conventional NIPA measures.,
,"There are several other sets of alternate accounts, the most important"
"of which is from Eisner (1985,1988). In an important article, Eisner (1988)",
"surveys six proposed extensions of NIPA, including his own and that of",
