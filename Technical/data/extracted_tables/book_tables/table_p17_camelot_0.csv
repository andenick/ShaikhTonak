This book  has been a long time in the making.  The interest in providing
an  empirical  framework  that  would  correspond  to  Marxian  categories
"dates back to 1972-73, when Anwar Shaikh first discovered Shane Mage's"
pathbreaking  work  and  developed  an alternate  schema  and an alternate
set of  estimates based on Mage's own data.
In  1974 Shaikh  came across  Edward  Wolff's  working paper on  input-
output-based  estimates  of  the rate of  surplus value in Puerto  Rico. This
added a new dimension to the problem. Mage's work emphasized the sig-
"nificance  of  the distinction  between  productive  and unproductive  labor,"
but  it was restricted to  only  the value-added  side of  national  income ac-
"counts. On the other hand, whereas Wolff's  work was located within the"
"more comprehensive double-entry  framework  of  input-output  accounts,"
it  did  not  distinguish  between  productive  and  unproductive  labor.  This
led Shaikh to attempt to develop a comprehensive  framework  for Marx-
ian categories which made both distinctions  simultaneously.
The procedure that emerged in 1975 was essentially the same one used
in  this  book:  a  mapping  between  Marxian  and  input-output  categories
illustrated  by  means  of  a  continuing  numerical  example  in  which  both
total  price (the sum of  purchasers' prices) and the magnitudes  of  the ag-
gregate value flows (total value and its basic components)  were held con-
"stant,  while  the  associated  money  forms  became  ever  more  complex  as"
"more concrete factors were considered. This allowed one to verify, at each"
"stage of  the argument,  that the overall mapping was correct."
"For a short time in the mid-1970s Wolff and Shaikh joined  forces,  but"
their paths soon diverged. By 1978 Shaikh had produced a final draft of a
paper  that  systematically  built  up  a mapping  between  Marxian  and  na-
"tional  income  account  categories,  provided  measures  of  the  rate of  sur-"
"plus value in the United States, and made some preliminary estimates (for"
