One of the peculiarities of  Stanfield's  methodology is that he measures
"all  aggregates  in  terms  of  their  cost  of  production,  not  at  their  market"
62  After-tax  noncorporate profits are derived by multiplying unincorporated income
by the corporate  fraction  of  after-tax  nonlabor income in total  income originat-
ing  in  corporations.  This  estimated  after-tax  noncorporate  nonlabor  income  is
reduced by the net interest payments of  unincorporated  enterprises (which show
up under the  net  interest  component  of  property-type  income)  to  yield  noncor-
"porate profits (Baran and Sweezy 1966, pp. 371-2). Total business profits are then"
adjusted to take account of what Phillips argues is a systematic overstatement  of
depreciation charges in official  accounts (pp. 372-8).
