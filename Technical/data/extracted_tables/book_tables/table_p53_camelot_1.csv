"are too  many middlemen!"" they say.  Maybe there are.  B u t . ..  the real"
test  for  all producers is whether they  satisfy  a consumer  demand  -  not
"how many pounds of  physical stuff they produce.  (Bach 1966, p. 45)"
The  thrust  of  this  logic  is  clear.  Either  the  definition  of  production
"is  confined  to  ""physical  stuff"" (goods),  or  else  it  must  be  broadened  to"
"include  all  ""services,"" the  latter  being  defined  to  encompass  all  market-"
"able activity. To the practical economist,  one who gathers the actual data"
"and renders these definitions  concrete,  this leads to the following  opera-"
"tional  criterion: If it is sold, or could be sold, then it is defined as produc-"
"tion.17  Thus  -  within  orthodox  accounts  -  commodity  traders,  private"
"guards, and even private armies are all deemed to be producers of  social"
"output,  because someone  is paying  for their services.  So too are all gov-"
"ernment employees and military personnel, in this case because their em-"
ployment  by  the  state  is  usually  taken  to  mean  that  the  society  deems
them necessary.18
"When we consider only production and personal consumption, the dis-"
tinction  between  them  is also  a distinction  between  labor  and  nonlabor
activity.  But  once  we  introduce  distribution  and  social  maintenance  ac-
"tivities, labor need no longer be an undifFerentiated  category.  Since clas-"
sical  and  Marxian  economics  view  distribution  and  social  maintenance
"as nonproduction activities, the corresponding portion of  labor becomes"
nonproduction  labor. Orthodox economists view these same activities as
"production.  For them,  all  labor is production  labor,  and the  distinction"
between production and consumption becomes synonymous with the dis-
tinction between labor and leisure.
"At an abstract level, the orthodox argument turns on the notion that mar-"
"ketability is equivalent to production.  But at a more concrete level, mar-"
"ketability is only a measure of the ability to attract money, and it rapidly"
becomes evident that money flows are not synonymous with counterflows
