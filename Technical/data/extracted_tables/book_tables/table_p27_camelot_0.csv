,account.  Further detail can then be added by subdividing the output side,
,into different  types of  producing  sectors and by subdividing the use side,
,into different  types of  users. Individual accounts can then be constructed,
"for business, household,  government,  and foreign sectors.",,
,Conventional  production accounts come in two basic forms:  national-,
income-and-product,accounts  (NIPA)  and input-output,(IO)  accounts.
,"Since  the  former  are only  concerned  with the final use  of  the  product,6",
,they focus solely on the net product.7 This is split into personal consump-,
"tion,  government  purchases,  private investment,  and net exports  on the",,
,"use side; and wages, profits,  and taxes on the revenue side.  Input-output",
,"accounts  go  one  step further,  in that they keep track  of  the whole prod-",
,uct.8  By including  the portions  of  the product  used as inputs by various,
,"industries, they are able to illuminate the structure of interindustrial pro-",
,duction relations in addition to capturing the main aggregates of  NIPA.,
,It is because of their greater coverage that we use them as our theoretical,
foil  in the development  of  our own accounting  framework.,,
,Both NIPA and IO accounts  focus  solely on production-related  flows.,
,"As  such,  they  leave  out  two  important  aspects  of  the  overall  economic",
,picture: transactions that are not directly related to production; and stocks,
of  real and financial wealth.,,
,Financial accounts  attempt to correct for the first limitation by expand-,
,ing the coverage of financial flows beyond those directly tied to production.,
