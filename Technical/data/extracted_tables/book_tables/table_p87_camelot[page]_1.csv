,price below  its value.  The  difference  between the two  sets of  sales is the,
,revenue of the domestic trade sector (the total trading margin on all goods,
,sold).  This  holds  even when  commodities  are sold to their final  users at,
,(purchasers')  prices proportional  to their values.,
,Exactly  the  same  thing  occurs  when  a  domestic  producer  exports  a,
,"commodity.  In this case,  however,  the value transferred  to the trade sec-",
"tor may be split up between domestic and foreign trading capitals, so that",,
only  a portion  of  the total  value is retained  within the country.  Exports,,
"therefore  transfer  value  out  of  a  nation,  ceteris  paribus,  in  an  amount",,
equal  to  the  trade  margin  of  the  foreign  trading  capital.  The  opposite,,
,holds  for  imports.  The  domestic  trading  capital  captures  a  portion  of,
,foreign value by acquiring a commodity below its final selling price (which,
,by assumption  is equal to its value).  Imports transfer value into  a coun-,
"try, other things being equal.",,
,"Tables  3.9-3.11  illustrate  these  arguments.  In  Table  3.9,  we  see  that",
,"in the  case  of  a domestically  produced  and used  commodity  (say steel),",
,the  total  value  of  the  product  (equal  to  its  purchaser's  price  of  100) is,
,"split up between the production sector (70), the domestic transportation",
,"sector (10), and the domestic trade sector (20). On the assumption that",
,"the  transportation  in  question  is  productive  transport,  a  total  value  of",
,100 is created by the production  sectors (steel producers and transport-,
,"ers), of  which 20 is transferred  to the domestic trade sector by virtue of",
,the  fact  that  the  total  producers' price  (80 =  70+10)  is  less  than  the,
total value.,,
,"The  same basic principle applies to exports and imports,  with the  dif-",
,"ference that the connection between producers, transporters, and traders",
,now  cuts across  national  boundaries  and thus gives rise to  international,
,transfers  of  value.  Keep  in  mind  that  our  definition  of  a  nation's  eco-,
,nomic boundary encompasses any transport by national carriers.,
,Table  3.10 applies this rule to the case of  an export.  The domestic  ex-,
,"port  price  -  the price received by domestic  producers, transporters,  and",
,traders - is defined as the domestic port price plus any cost of international,
