limits of the approximation of the Marxian final product added by GDP,
,"(see Table 5.4), we can therefore approximate the trend of the true mea-"
sure by the ratio of real GDP to hours of productive labor  Hp:,
17,Implicit  in such a calculation is the notion that the differences  in productive and
,unproductive wage rates do not reflect differences in skill. Insofar as part of such
,"wage  differentials  do  reflect  skill  differences,  the  skill-adjusted  relative  rates  of"
,exploitation  will  be  even  closer  than  our  unadjusted  figures.  It  should  also  be
,borne  in  mind  that  the  productive  and  unproductive  sectors  are  aggregates  of
,"very many individual  sectors,  so  factors  such as gender and race discrimination"
,are likely to be fairly similar across such broad composites.
