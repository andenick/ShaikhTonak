indirect taxes.
"Finally, the households,  government,  and foreigners  supported out of"
primary-sector revenues may pay a portion (RYC + RYg + RYx_m) of their
"incomes over to the secondary sectors as ground rent, net interest, and so"
"forth.  Because  such  transfers  take  place  ""downstream"" of  the  primary"
"sectors' gross output,  value added, and profits,  the originating flows will"
"not  be  affected.  Of  course,  the  receipt  of  these  payments  will  increase"
"revenues of the secondary sector, and orthodox accounts will register this"
"increased revenue as an increase in gross output.  On the use side, ortho-"
dox  accounts  record the transfers  in question as purchases of  secondary
"sector  output,  to  be listed in the household-,  government-,  and  foreign-"
sector columns of final demand; this raises the aggregate measure of final
"demand.  Since none of  the primary-sector measures are affected,  and all"
"of the secondary-sector measures are raised, the aggregate orthodox mea-"
sures are all raised relative to the corresponding  Marxian measures. The
same  argument  applies  to  profit-type  income  relative  to  surplus  value.
This  latter  result  gives  rise  to  the  possibility  that  profit  can  actually  be
"greater than surplus value,  owing  solely to the manner of  circulation  of"
the product.  We will examine this new and striking result in more detail
in Section 3.2.2.
"In  summary,  royalty  flows  increase  the  orthodox  measures  of  gross"
output  GO and gross product  GP  relative to their Marxian counterparts
total  value TV and total  product TP.  But the effect  on the  magnitude
of  conventional  value added VA and final demand FD relative to Marx-
ian value added VA and final product FP is not similarly determinate.
Royalty  payments  by  primary  sectors  to  the  secondary  sectors  decrease
"orthodox measures relative to Marxian ones, but royalty payments  from"
"the  primary  sectors  to  households,  government,  and  foreigners  have  no"
effect  on  the  relative  positions  of  Marxian  and  orthodox  measure.  And
"royalty payments made by households, government, and foreigners to the"
secondary  sectors  increase  orthodox  measures  relative  to  their  Marxian
counterparts. The same can be said for measures of aggregate  profit-type
income  (the  sum  of  profits  and  royalties)  relative  to  aggregate  surplus
value.  Thus the overall  effect  of  royalty flows on  orthodox  measures  of
"value added, final demand, and aggregate profit, relative to their Marxian"
"counterparts, is indeterminate. A more detailed derivation of these results"
is provided in Appendix B.
