and  increase the measure of  total  gross product  GP  by adding  a row  of,
disbursements  to  the  royalties  sector  from  all  other  sectors.  From  our,
"point of  view, these are merely records of transfers,  and must be left  out",
"of  our measures of  total  value TV and total product TP. Thus, as be-",
"fore,  TV = GOp + GOt  and  TP = GPp + GPt.  We  will  see  shortly  that",
the same principles apply to the general government  sector.,
,The  effects  on  orthodox  measures  of  value  added  and profit  are a bit
"more  complex.  There are three possibilities,  depending  on whether roy-",
alty payments are treated as costs or disbursements.,
,"First, primary sectors' accounts treat some particular type of  royalties"
(RYP + RYt) paid to the secondary sectors as costs  and hence record them,
among  intermediate  inputs  (by  adding  them  to  intermediate  inputs  and,
then subtracting them from value added by creating a matching negative,
"entry  for ""imputed  interest  received""). This is the case with ground rent",
"paid to the real estate sector and net interest paid to the financial sector,11",
so  that  the  measured  level  of  the  value  added  of  the  primary  sectors  is,
"reduced by this amount.  At the same time, the receipt of these payments",
shows up as the total revenue (GOry = RYp + RYt) of the royalties sector.,
But since some of this is absorbed by the intermediate inputs (Mry) of the,
"royalties  sector,  the  amount  that  re-appears  as  the  value  added  of  the",
royalties  sector  is less than the amount  that  was lost  to the value  added,
of  the primary sectors on the original transfer.  Thus the IO-NIPA  mea-,
sure  of  aggregate  value  added  VA  falls  below  its  Marxian  counterpart,
VA (see Section B.2.2). The reduction in the orthodox measure of aggre-,
"gate profit-type  income (profits,  rents, and interest) relative to aggregate",
"surplus value is even greater, because a portion of the value added of the",
"secondary  sector  is  also  absorbed  in its  wage bill.  Finally,  to  the  extent",
,"that  rents  and  (some)  interest  payments  are treated  as  costs,  aggregate"
profit  will be even smaller.,
,"Second, some types of royalties are treated as disbursements  from value"
added  (RYp-f RYt').  These  comprise  net  interest  and  dividends  paid  to,
"households,  foreigners,  and the government,  as well as indirect business",
taxes.12  Such  payments  leave  the  conventional  measure  of  the  primary,
sectors' total  value added  unchanged  (although  they may change the di-,
vision  between  profits  and  royalties).  Since these  disbursements  are not,
"made  directly  to  the  secondary  sectors,  total  business  revenues  are  also",
