"acter from most of  the others, and has different  implications."
The basic problem arises from the fact that conventional accounts clas-
"sify many activities as ""production,"" when in fact they should be classified"
"as  forms  of  social  consumption.  For  example,  the  military,  the  police,"
and  private  guards  protect  property  and  social  structure.  Civil  servants
and lawyers administer rules and laws. Traders in commodities and paper
circulate wealth or titles to it.  It is our contention that such activities are
"actually forms of  social consumption,  not production."
Consider  the  basic  difference  between  production  and  consumption.
"Production activity uses up wealth to create new wealth (i.e., to achieve a"
production outcome).  Personal consumption uses up wealth to maintain
"and reproduce the individual (a nonproduction outcome). In like manner,"
"military,  police,  administrative,  and  trading  activities  use  up  wealth  in"
"the pursuit of  protection, distribution,  and administration  (also nonpro-"
"duction  outcomes).  The  issue  is  not  one  of  necessity,  because  all  these"
"activities are necessary, in some form or the other, for social reproduction"
"(Beckerman 1968, pp. 27-8). Rather, the issue concerns the nature of the"
"outcome;  protection,  distribution,  and  administration  are  really  forms"
"of  social consumption,  not production."
At  the  heart  of  this  discussion  is  a  distinction  between  outcome  and
output.  Not all outcomes are outputs. This is evidently the case with per-
"sonal consumption, whose outcome is the maintenance of the individual,"
not  the  production  of  new  wealth.  It  is  our  contention  that  the  same
reasoning applies to the other social activities listed.
It should be emphasized that the distinction being made is between pro-
"duction  and  nonproduction  activities,  not  between  goods  and  services."
We  shall  see  that  a  substantial  portion  of  service  activities  (transporta-
"tion, lodging, entertainment, repairs, etc.) will be classified under produc-"
"tion,  whereas  others  (wholesale/retail,  financial  services,  legal  services,"
"advertising, military, civil service, etc.) will be classified as nonproduction"
activities. The real distinction is between outcomes and output. All activity
"results in outcomes.  Some outcomes  are also outputs, directly adding to"
"social  wealth.  But others preserve or circulate this wealth, or help main-"
tain and administer the social structure in which it is embedded. One way
to formalize these distinctions is to imagine a list (a vector) of  properties
"associated  with  every  commodity.  Some  of  these  characteristics,  to  use"
