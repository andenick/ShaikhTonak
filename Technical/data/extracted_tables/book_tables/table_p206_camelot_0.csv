largely  offsetting  each  other  in  the  determination  of  the  rate  of  surplus
"value.  Figure  6.9  compares  the various  estimates  to  ours,  with  Shaikh's"
estimates  included  as a point  of  reference  for  Moseley.  It is evident that
Moseley's  rate  of  surplus  value  essentially  duplicates  the  movements  in
"Shaikh's  estimates.  On  the  other  hand,  Tonak's  measure  approximates"
"ours fairly well up to 1963, but then increasingly overestimates it."
The  first  systematic  investigation  of  the  effects  of  state  taxation  and
redistribution on the rate of  surplus value appears in Shaikh (1978b). He
defines  the  net  tax  on  labor  as the  difference  between  actual  taxes  paid
by workers to the state and the social  benefit  expenditures  directed back
toward workers by the state. The effective  wage of workers is their nomi-
"nal wage minus any net tax (or plus any ""social wage,"" should the net tax"
happen  to  be  positive).  Because  the  wages  of  unproductive  workers are
"part  of  surplus  value,  any  net  tax  on  their  wages  amounts  to  a  transfer"
within surplus value from them to the state. But in the case of  productive
"workers, such a transfer redefines  variable capital itself,  since the net tax"
