order  to  recover  the  magnitude  of  produced  value. Our  empirical mea-,,
,"sures do not include such an adjustment,  although we do estimate it to be",
relatively small for the United States (Section 3.6).,,
,"On the whole, royalties flows increase the orthodox measures of gross",
,"output  and  gross  product  relative  to  their  Marxian  counterparts,  total",
,value and total product. But the effect  on the magnitude of conventional,
,valuâ‚¬ added  and final demand relative to Marxian value added and  final,
,product turns out to be theoretically indeterminate. The same can be said,
,for measures of aggregate profit-type income (the sum of profits and roy-,
,alties) relative to aggregate surplus value (Section 3.2.1; see also Appen-,
dix B).,,
7.3  Empirical  results,,
,"At an empirical level, Marxian total product TP* is roughly 82%",
,"of the IO measure of gross product  GP, but about  1.5 times larger than",
,"the  conventional  measure  of  GNP.  Marxian  gross final product  GFP*,",
,"on the other hand, is about  15% smaller than GNP (Table 5.4). Surplus",
,value S* is almost double the most inclusive measure of profit-type income,
,"P +  (defined  as  NNP  minus  employee  compensation),  while  productive",
,"labor  Lp is less than one-half  of all employment  L. As a result, the rate",
,of surplus value SVV* is typically almost 4 times as large as the ratio of,
,"profit-type  income to employee compensation P+/EC, while the Marxian",
,measure of productivity q* (defined  as real total product per productive,
,labor hour) is about 3 times as large as the conventional measure (defined,
,"as real GDP per labor hour) (Section 5.12, Table 5.14).",
,Trends over the postwar  period  also differ.  Marxian total product de-,
,"creases slightly relative to IO gross product, and also declines slightly rel-",
,"ative to GNP (except for 1973-77, when the oil-price rise, which shows up",
