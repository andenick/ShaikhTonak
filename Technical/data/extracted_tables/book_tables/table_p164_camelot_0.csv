"therefore,  to  ascertain whether  a simpler and more intuitive  approxima-"
tion  of  the  rate of  surplus value can be constructed.  This  has particular
importance  for  countries  and  periods  in  which  the  necessary  detail  for
more precise estimates is unavailable.
Variable capital is the employee compensation of production workers in
productive sectors. One widely used approximation  (see the estimates by
"Labor  Research  Association  1948,  Eaton  1966,  and  Papadimitriou  1988"
in Section 6.2.2) is to take the total employee compensation (of both pro-
duction  and  nonproduction  workers)  in the  productive  sectors  (agricul-
"ture, mining,  construction,  transportation  and public utilities,  manufac-"
"turing,  and productive  services). Note that this proposed  approximation"
"V' would be larger than the actual variable capital V, because it would"
include the wages of  nonproductive  workers in the productive sectors.
A  commonly  cited definition  of  Marxian value added is the sum of  all
"wages,  profits,  taxes,  interest,  and  rents  (e.g.,  Gillman  1958  in  Section"
6.2.1).  In Section  3.2.1 we saw that  orthodox  NNP  is the sum of  all sec-
"toral  wages,  profits,  and  taxes,  plus  sectoral  net  interest  paid  to  house-"
"holds, government,  and foreigners.  Net interest paid by businesses to the"
