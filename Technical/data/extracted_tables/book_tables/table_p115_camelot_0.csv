Empirical  estimates  of  Marxian  categories,95
We have:,
"CJ, = M'p = materials inputs into production;",
C5 =  (Dp) = depreciation of productive fixed capital;,
C =  Mp + Dp = constant capital used up (flow);,
GVA s  TV -  C  = Marxian gross value added;,
VA = TV -  C = GVA -  C J =  Marxian (net) value added.,
Our estimation procedure then consists of three steps:,
"(i)  The  three  items  in  braces  {GVAp,GVAtt,Dp}  are calculated  di-",
,"rectly  from  NIPA,  by  aggregating  individual  NIPA  industries"
,into  production  and  total  trade  sectors  in  much  the  same  way
"that we aggregated input-output  sectors earlier,",
"(ii)  The  four  components  Mp,  RYp,  M'tt,  and  RYtt  are  interpolated",
"between benchmark  years in a manner to be described  shortly,",
"(iii)  The  GVAs,  Ms,  and  RYs are used  to  form  GOP and  GOtt,  and",
,"their  sums  give  us TV.  Dp and  Mp  give us C  and C^,  respec-"
"tively,  which in turn allow us to calculate GVA and VA.",
"The calculation of TP follows the same general procedure. For instance,",
from  Figure 5.1 we can write,
Figure 5.1 also makes it clear that the Marxian final-use categories such,
"as CON, I ,...  can be derived by reducing the corresponding NIPA mea-",
"sures  CON,I,...  by  those  items  which  are  excluded  from  the  Marxian",
"measure  (i.e.,  which  fall  outside  the  dashed  hatched  rectangle  and  the",
"cross-hatched section around IVA in Figure 5.1), as well as by those items",
"already  excluded  from  our  benchmark  tables  (e.g.,  the  imputed  rental",
"component GVAir in consumption, as shown in Appendix B.I and Figure",
B.I).  We have:,
CON =  (CON) -  GVAir -  RYcon -  (HHcon) -  ROWcon;,
=  {X-IM}-RYx_im-ROWx_im;,
G =  {G}-RYG-(WG}-ROWG.,
Once again we proceed in three steps.,
,"4  As noted earlier, the inventory valuation adjustment  IVA was merged into value"
"added on the revenue side, and hence into I on the use side.",
