comparison  of  the two tables available for 1972.
A.2.4  Eating  and drinking  places
"In the tables from 1947 to 1967, eating and drinking places are in-"
"cluded in the retail trade industry; however, they are treated separately in"
1972 and 1977 (industry 74). If it were only a disaggregation of the indus-
trial classification  then there would be no problem in keeping the consis-
"tency between both presentations.  However,  the trade industry is a mar-"
gin industry that records only the margin added at the time of the business
"transaction.  When  eating  and  drinking  places  are  treated  as  trade,  the"
food appears as directly sold by the food industry to the consumer (house-
"holds  or  another  industry),  and  only  the  costs  and  the  value  added  of"
"preparing  the meal  are accounted  for  in the trade industry.  In contrast,"
"when eating and drinking places are treated separately, the food  appears"
"as  input  for  the  eating  and  drinking  places  industry,  and  the  output  of"
this industry  includes  not  only the costs  and the value  added  of  prepar-
ing the meal but also the value of  the intermediary goods. Therefore the
change in treatment results in an important change in the proportion be-
tween input and value added in the input-output tables. In order to correct
"this inconsistency between the different  studies, the elements necessary to"
separately compute eating and drinking places in the earlier studies have
been roughly estimated between 1947 and 1967.
The first step was to determine the total output  of  eating and drinking
places. For 1947 this task was made easier with the information  included
in the original version of  a table published by Leontief  (1951) and Evans
"and Hoffenberg  (1952).2 The original study,  although incompatible in its"
"methodology  with  later  studies,  treats  eating  and  drinking  places  sepa-"
"rately.  For  1958,  1963, and  1967, the figures published  by the  Economic"
Growth Project (BLS1979) were used. The main destination of eating and
drinking  places'  production  is  of  course  household  consumption.  This
"item is reported in the NIPA (BEA 1986) in table 2.4, line 4.  In each year"
