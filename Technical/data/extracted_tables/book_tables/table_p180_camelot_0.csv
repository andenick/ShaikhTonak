6.2.1  Sectoral money value estimates
"Varga (1928, 1935) provides the earliest  set of  sectoral estimates"
of the rate of  surplus value. The methodology he developed remains in-
"fluential to  this  day.  Basing  himself  on  manufacturing  census  data,  he"
"measures variable  capital  as the wages of  production  workers, and  (the"
money form of)  surplus value as the excess of net value added over vari-
"able  capital,11  for  seven  benchmark  years  from  1899 to  1931. In  a later"
study (Varga  1964) he also attempts to update these figures to cover the
"period 1947-58, but these subsequent estimates contain two major  calcu-"
lation  errors:  for  variable  capital  he mistakenly  uses all wages and sal-
"aries, rather than the production  worker wages he used in earlier years;"
and for surplus value he mistakenly uses gross value added rather than the
excess of gross value added over wage costs (however defined). Although
"these two errors have offsetting  effects  on his data, they render his post-"
war estimates useless.12 They also invalidate his analysis of the long-term
