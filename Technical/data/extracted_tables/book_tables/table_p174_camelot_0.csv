Figure 6.2.  Rate of surplus value S/V and profit/wage  ratio PVEC.

"by some measure of  the profit/wage  ratio, so that  the levels and move-"
ments of the former are deduced from those of the latter (except perhaps
"for  any disturbing  influence  of  price-value  deviations). Yet, as we have"
"seen, such an association is utterly mistaken, both theoretically and em-"
"pirically (cf.  Section 3.6.1 and Table 3.12; Section 5.4). Figure 6.2, which"
"reproduces  Figure  5.13, makes it particularly  clear that  the  profit/wage"
ratio  (defined  here  as the  ratio  of  NNP  minus employee  compensation
over employee compensation) is neither an index of the level nor the trend
of the rate of surplus value.

"Glyn and Sutcliffe's  (1972) study is one of the earliest, and most"
"influential,  of this type. The authors argue (p. 54) that the secular post-"
war decline in the British rate of profit  lies at the heart of the stagnation
of capital accumulation  in Britain. And since the capital/output  ratio is
"roughly stable, the decline in the profit  rate can in turn be attributed to a"
"secular fall in the profit share.4 But a fall in the profit share is ""an increase"
