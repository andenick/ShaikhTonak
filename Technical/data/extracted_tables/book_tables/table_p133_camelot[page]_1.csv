times  as large as the latter.  It also  rises by over 40 during the  postwar

"directly shown would be EC. Hence,  P + = V A - EC =  N N P - E C."

largely due to the fact that V =  Wp Â«. EC. But we cannot assume that the rough
equality  that  holds  for  the United States between the two value-added  measures
is a universal  phenomenon.
