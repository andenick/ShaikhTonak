"rental receipts. He even subtracts estimates of the  ""direct taxes imposed on",
"individual recipients of surplus value"" (Mage 1963, p. 166), on the grounds",
"that surplus value should represent only the ""net income of  the . ..  capi-",
"talists"" (p. 36), ""i.e., after-tax  net property income"" (p. 164).35 Although",
"he does not make it clear, presumably  he would add all of  these taxes to",
"constant capital, as he did with indirect business taxes.36 Not surprisingly,",
his measure of  surplus value is substantially  lower than ours.37,
,Mage's  actual  estimate  of  variable  capital  is  also  quite  different  from
ours. The exclusion of agriculture and government enterprises would make,
,his estimates smaller than ours even if all other things were equal. More-
,"over, he reduces his measure of variable capital by ""the estimated portion"
"of  it paid as direct taxes by individual  recipients of  labor income"" (1963,",
"p.  167).  This  at  least  has  the  virtue  of  consistency,  since  it  parallels  his",
treatment  of  property-type  income.  But there is still  an inconsistency  in,
,"his treatment of the unincorporated sector, which further reduces his mea-"
sure of  variable  capital:  when he calculates  the portion  of  surplus value,
which corresponds to unincorporated enterprise profits in the production,
,"and trade sectors, he does so by subtracting the estimated wage (the wage"
equivalent WEQ) of  proprietors and partners from the total value added,
of  unincorporated  enterprises.  This  removes  both  the  productive  wage,
equivalent  (corresponding  to the productive portion of  the labor of pro-,
prietors and partners) and the unproductive wage equivalent.  To be con-,
"sistent,  he should have then added the former to variable capital and the",
"latter  to  total  unproductive  wages; but  he neglects  to  do  either.  We,  on",
"the other hand, do both.38  Consequently,  his measure of  variable capital",
is somewhat  lower than ours.39,
