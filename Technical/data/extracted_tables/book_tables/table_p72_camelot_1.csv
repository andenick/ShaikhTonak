3.2  Secondary flows
Production and trade activities derive their revenues directly from
the sale of the commodity product. These primary flows in turn give rise
"to a series of secondary flows, such as payments for ground rent,8 finance"
"charges, fees, royalties, and taxes."
Secondary sectors are  therefore  defined  by  the  fact  that  they  derive
their revenues from the recirculation of the money flows generated by the
"primary sectors, or from the circulation of socially validated claims upon"
"portions of  these primary  flows,  or both. Thus, (pure) ground  rent9 (as"
"opposed  to building  and  equipment  rental,  which we have already ana-"
"lyzed)  is  a  royalty  paid  for  access  to  land,  interest  a  royalty  paid  for"
"access to money and credit,  and a patent or other  fee a royalty paid  for"
"access to a particular process of some sort. The sale of land, of  financial"
"instruments, and of patent rights then circulates the claims to these royal-"
"ties. A similar conclusion applies to taxes, which are (quite literally) roy-"
alty payments made to a sovereign social power.
