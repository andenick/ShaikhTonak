nonproduction activities.
1  Shaikh (1989) develops a general Marxian model of  effective  demand in a growth
context. He shows that a rise in the exogenously given average propensity to con-
sume c stimulates a jump in the level of production (this is the short-term demand
"effect  of  a relative rise in consumption), while it also sets into motion a decline in"
the growth rate (this is the long-term growth effect of a decline in the savings rate).
"2  From Table 3.8, S* = P + IBT + (W, + Mt), where P = profits net of indirect busi-"
"ness tax IBT but gross of  direct profit  taxes.  If we define the latter as TP,  profits"
"net of  that as Pn, T = TP + IBT, and Eu =  (Wt + Mt), then S* = Pn + TP + Eu."
