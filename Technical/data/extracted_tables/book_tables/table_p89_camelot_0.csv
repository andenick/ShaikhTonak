"This  total  is,  of  course,  the  same  as  the  value  retained  by  the  foreign",,,
country.,,,
,It  follows  that  value  can  be transferred  between  nations  -  even when,,
,all final selling prices are equal to values  -  depending  on the balance be-,,
,tween the value transferred in through imports and the value transferred,,
,out through exports. This is a systematic effect  whose direction is tied to,,
,"the location of the commodity within foreign trade (as export or import),",,
,quite  different  from  the  indeterminate  direction  of  transfers  associated,,
,"with purchaser  price-value  deviations. Relative  producer  prices, includ-",,
,"ing  domestic  export  and  import  prices,  are relative prices of  production",,
,whose deviation from relative values depends on the relative organic cap-,,
,itals of the sectors and the relative efficiency  of the capitals within a given,,
,sector  (Shaikh  1980a).  But  all  producer  prices  are  less  than  purchaser,,
,prices because  of  the intervening  domestic  and foreign  trading margins.,,
,"Thus  the  transfers  of  value  due  to  trading  margins  are  unidirectional,",,
,"from producers to traders. On the other hand, purchaser price-value de-",,
,viations  are the  synthesis  of  factors  causing  relative  producer  prices  to,,
,deviate from relative values and factors causing absolute producer prices,,
to be less than purchaser prices.,,,
,"For the analysis of international transfers of value, the trading-margin",,
,transfers are clearly more fundamental than those arising from purchaser,,
,price-value deviations. The latter are easily introduced into the analysis.,,
,Any  (positive  or negative)  deviation between purchaser prices and direct,,
,prices  (prices  proportional  to  values)  must  be  added  to  the  previously,,
,analyzed  deviations  between  domestic  import  and export  prices and the,,
,"corresponding  purchaser  prices.  As  shown  in  what  follows,  the  overall",,
,transfer can be derived directly by substituting direct prices for purchaser,,
,prices in Tables  3.10 and  3.11. But it is more useful  to  show the two sets,,
,"of  deviations  separately,  since they are determined differently.  The mea-",,
,"sures Tx, Tim, and T are constructed so that a transfer in is positive and a",,
transfer out is negative:,,,
