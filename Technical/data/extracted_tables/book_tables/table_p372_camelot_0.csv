"a  BEA (1976): table 8.2,  lines 39 and 41."
"b  Mage (1963): [p. 252, table B-IV, column d (after-tax  corporate net rents paid)] + [p. 255,"
"table B-V, column d (after-tax  noncorporate net rents paid)] + [p. 271, table D-III,  column"
e (real estate tax)].
"from  Internal  Revenue  Service  data,3  simply  by  adding  the  imputed in-"
terest received by the production and trade sectors (which is listed in sep-
arate NIPA tables) back into NIPA net interest. The problem of net rents
"paid is somewhat more complicated,  since these are treated as part of the"
"costs of  operation (intermediate inputs) rather than value added,  so that"
"they appear only in input-output tables. For this category, we use Mage's"
own  estimates.  Table  M.3  illustrates  the  steps  in  the  calculation  of  the
"NIPA  equivalent  of  Mage's  capitalist  sector  gross  product  in  1958,  and"
compares the final estimate with Mage's own (laboriously built-up) total.
"Although  our procedure  is considerably  simpler,  it produces  virtually"
the same result as Mage's. The difference between the two estimates is less
than six-tenths of  one percent.  Table M.4 breaks down our  NIPA-based
"estimate into three broad elements: indirect business taxes, employee com-"
"pensation,  and gross profit-type  income  (defined  as NIPA profit-type re-"
"turn,  net interest plus imputed interest received, and capitalist consump-"
"tion  allowances),  and  compares  these  components  to  the  corresponding"
ones in Mage.
It is apparent that differences between individual components are some-
"what greater than between totals, though no individual component  differs"
by more than 6%-7%. Both indirect business taxes and employee compen-
"sation are larger in Mage than in our NIPA-based estimates, while profit-"
type income is correspondingly  smaller.  But this seems to be due to revi-
"sions within the NIPA data itself, since the figures in Mage are from earlier"
"publications than the ones we use: Mage (1963, p. 176) takes his data from"
a  1962 publication.
3  Mage also uses  IRS data to estimate actual  net rent paid.  But this is already in-
"cluded in NIPA gross value added.  Furthermore,  as we are concerned only with"
"the  GVA  of  the  production  and  trade  sectors,  no  adjustment  is needed  for  im-"
puted rentals since these appear only in the revenue of  the rental sector.
