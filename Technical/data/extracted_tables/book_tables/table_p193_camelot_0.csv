"be corrected  for  the net  tax on productive workers, and quotes  Callaghan"
"to the effect  that the costs of  ""social services for the workers... is broadly"
"met  from  within  the working  class  itself"" (Eaton  1966, p. 216). Our  own"
detailed  estimates  of  the  net  tax  lead  us to  precisely the  same  conclusion
"(see  Section  5.9).  At  an  empirical  level,  Eaton  restricts  the  definition  of"
"productive  sectors to those producing  goods  only,  so that  all services  are"
"treated  as unproductive.  In addition,  he assumes that  productive  labor  is"
all labor within productive sectors and that unproductive labor is all labor
"within  unproductive  sectors.  On  this  basis,  he  estimates  the  rate  of  sur-"
plus value  in the United  Kingdom  to  be 186 in 1937.
Mage (1963) raises the discussion of the relation between Marxian cate-
gories  and  national  income  accounts  to  an  entirely  new  level.  He  is  the
first  to  really  address  the  issue  at  a  general  (as  opposed  to  a  sectoral)
"level,  and  the  first  to  attempt  estimates  in  both  price  and  labor  value"
quantities  -  although  he fails  at the latter.  Mage begins with a  systematic
"and  wide-ranging  presentation  of  Marx's  theory  of  value,  price,  surplus"
"value,  productive  and  unproductive  labor  (in which  services are  counted"
"as  productive),  accumulation,  effective  demand,  long-term  profitability,"
"and  crises (Mage  1963, chaps.  I-V).  His primary goal in this section is to"
locate Marx's argument  about the long-term tendencies of the rate of  sur-
"plus  value,  the  organic  composition  of  capital,  and  the  general  rate  of"
profit.  The  rest  of  his  work  (chaps.  VI-VIII)  is devoted  to  deriving  em-
pirical estimates of basic Marxian categories in order to test the empirical
validity  of  Marx's  propositions.
Although  Mage's  approach  to  the  relation  between  Marxian  and  or-
"thodox categories is quite sophisticated,  it suffers  from  one major  defect."
"Namely,  he never provides a systematic treatment  of the overall  mapping"
"between  the  two  sets  of  categories.  Instead,  he  proceeds  by  estimating"
separate components of various Marxian categories and then adding them
up to arrive at individual  desired magnitudes  such as variable capital  and
(his  definition  of)  surplus  value.  The elements  that  do  not  enter  his  def-
initions  of  these  measures  tend  to  disappear  from  view  (which  cannot
