The  summary  input-output  tables  of  Appendix  C  provide  benchmark-
year estimates  of  Marxian variables and their orthodox  counterparts.  In
"order to convert these into annual estimates, we use annual NIPA data for"
value-added and final-demand quantities. But input-output variables such
"as intermediate inputs M, royalties RY, and rest-of-world flows ROW are"
"unavailable in NIPA.  For these variables,  we interpolate between input-"
output benchmark  values in the following  manner.
"(1)  In each input-output year, we calculate the ratio of the component"
to either its using or receiving industry's gross value added. For material
"inputs  M'  (and  depreciation  D  later  on),  we  utilize  the  using  industry's"
"GVA. Thus for Mp we create the ratio xp =  (Mp/GVAp)IO, where the sub-"
script IO indicates that both variables are from input-output  tables. For
royalties RY we use the receiving industry's GVA (i.e.  GVAry) as the nu-
"meraire,  as in Xj =  (RYi/GVAry)Io.  This is done because  some royalties,"
"such as RYj and RYx_im, appear (respectively) as components of the highly"
"unstable final-demand totals  I and  X - IM 
(see  Figure C.I).  Benchmark"
coefficients  created  by dividing  these royalties  by unstable  totals  are not
very  useful.  The  same  reasoning  applies  to  the  ROW  entries  in  Figure
"C.I,  which  are  divided  by  total  ROW  in  order  to  form  coefficients  for"
"extrapolation,  as in xrOw  =  ROWg/ROW."
(2)  All  coefficients  created as described  in (1) are linearly  interpolated
between benchmark (IO) years. The result is an annual series for each co-
"efficient,  derived entirely from input-output  data."
"(3)  The  annual  observation  for  each  coefficient 
is  multiplied  by  the"
"NIPA measure of the relevant gross value added (or ROW, in the case of"
