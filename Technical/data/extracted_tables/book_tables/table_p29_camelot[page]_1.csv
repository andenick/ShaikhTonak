,Wolff develops labor value estimates by applying the theoretical  frame-,,
,work  developed  by Morishima  (1973) to actual  input-output  tables for,,
,"Puerto  Rico (Wolff  1975, 1977a) and for the United  States (Wolff 1979,",,
,1986).  This  allows  him to directly  address  the question  of  price-value,,
,deviations by comparing his estimates of the money rates of surplus value,,
"to the corresponding  value rate.  In these particular  studies, Wolff  does",,,
,not distinguish between productive and unproductive labor.,,
,"In his study of Puerto Rico, Wolff explicitly identifies the  profit/wage",,
,ratio as the equivalent  of the money  form  of the rate of surplus value.,,
,"However, he arrives at the striking result that  (at least for Puerto Rico)",,
,the  problem  of price-value  deviations  has so great  an impact  that the,,
,money form of the rate of surplus value (the profit/wage  ratio in his cal-,,
,"culations) is a ""poor  proxy"" for either the level or the trend of the true",,
,"(labor value) rate of surplus value (Wolff 1975, p. 940). Wolff's  data indi-",,
,cate that the money rate of surplus value is only 60-80 of the value,,
,"rate. Moreover, the money rate displays a significant rise even as the value",,
,rate is actually falling. Table 6.1 reproduces Wolff's  estimates for Puerto,,
Rico.,,,
,"There are two separate issues involved here. First of all, there is the large",,
,discrepancy between the money and value measures of the rate of surplus,,
,value. This problem apparently arises from the fact that Wolff treats rela-,,
,"tive wages as indexes of skills (Shaikh 1978b, p. 13). Wolff points out that",,
,the discrepancy between his money and labor value measures of the rate,,
,of surplus value depend primarily on the ratio of the direct price (price pro-,,
,portional to labor value) of consumption goods to their market price.8 The,,
