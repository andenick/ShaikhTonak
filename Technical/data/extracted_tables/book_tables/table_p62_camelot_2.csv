,"production, that workers' consumption is equal to their wages, that capi-",
,"talist  consumption  is equal  in magnitude to one half  of  profits,  and that",

"tories,  and  ""unintended  inventory  investment""  (i.e.  unsold  or  oversold",,
,goods)  will  be  equal  to  the  other  half  of  profits.  This latter  assumption,
,does  not  imply  that  sectoral  or  aggregate  supply  and  demand  balance.,
,"Rather,  it is simply a standard accounting  device in which the  difference",
,"between  supply  and  demand  is  added  to  the  ""total  investment""  on  the",
,"use side as ""unintended inventory change"" so as to make the revenue and",
,use  sides  balance  ex post.  Table  3.3  provides  a numerical  illustration  of,
these basic principles.,,
,Table  3.4  compares  the  Marxian  and  IO  representations  of  the  flows,
,portrayed  in Table 3.3.  Precisely because we are considering  production,
,"alone,  the correspondence  is straightforward:  Constant  capital  C is the",
,"same as intermediate input  M,  variable capital V the same as wages W,",
,"surplus value S the same as profits  (profit-type  income), and total value",
,TV the same as gross output GO. The relation between Marxian and IO,
,"measures of the use side is equally transparent, at this level of abstraction.",
,The  Marxian  measure  of  the  amount  of  product  used  as inputs  U  will,
,be the same as the corresponding IO measure of intermediate demand M;,
