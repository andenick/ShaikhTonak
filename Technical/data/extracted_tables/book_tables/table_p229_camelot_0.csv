National  economic  accounts  provide  the  empirical  foundation  for  eco-
nomic theory and policy.  And at the core of  all national  accounts lie the
"production  accounts,  for  it  is  the  production  of  new  wealth  which  has"
"been, at least so far, the real foundation  of  modern economic success."
The  classical  economists  were  deeply  concerned  with  the  factors  that
accounted  for  the  economic  success  or  failure  of  nations.  Their  analy-
sis  of  the  structure  of  production  led  them  to  the  recognition  that  not
"all  activities  resulted  in  a  product.  On  the  contrary,  they  classified  cer-"
"tain  activities  -  such  as  wholesale/retail  trade,  military  and  police,  and"
administration  -  as forms  of  social  consumption  rather than of  produc-
tion.  It  followed  from  this that  one  had to  distinguish  between  produc-
"tion and nonproduction labor. As we have emphasized throughout,  such"
a distinction does not imply that one of the forms of labor is more neces-
"sary, more meritorious, or more politically correct. Nor, in spite of Adam"
"Smith,  does  it  imply  that  services  cannot  be  production  activities.  The"
basic distinction arises from the difference  between outcome and output;
not all outcomes are outputs. We noted in Chapters 1 and 2 that one way
to formalize the difference would be in terms of a vector of characteristics
"associated with each commodity,  some of which would affect  its status as"
"an object of  social use,  and others its status as an object of  distribution,"
et cetera. This would be an adaptation of the approach proposed by Lan-
caster  (1968) within the structure of  neoclassical  economics.  Needless  to
"say, our approach would still differ in substance from a neoclassical  one."
To  the  extent  that  nonproduction  outcomes  require  the  performance
"of  labor and the consumption  of  use values, they are, like personal con-"
"sumption  itself,  forms  of  social  consumption.  Marx takes the  argument"
"even  further.  To  him,  the  growth  of  capitalist  economies  is  fueled  by"
"profit.  Profit  in  turn  depends  on  two  sources,  profit  on  alienation  and"
