difference  between the sum of  such flows and the surplus value that sup-,

"money  equivalent  of  this  surplus  value,  we must  be mindful  of  the  fact",
that  our measure will pick  up some part of  profit  on alienation.  For the,
"United States, with its highly developed capitalist sphere and its relatively",
,"small  foreign  trade  sector,  the  error  in associating  aggregate profit  with"
"aggregate  surplus value  appears to  be small.20  But in earlier times,  or in",
"less  developed  capitalist  nations,  no  such  a  priori  identification  can  be",
made.  It would then be necessary to explicitly  separate profit  on surplus,
value from profit  on alienation.,
