"the case of the royalties sector, this means leaving out the royalties-sector",,
,column on the revenue side; and leaving out royalty payments from the con-,
,"sumption, investment, government, and net-trade columns on the use side,",
,"since these are transfer payments, not purchases of use values (Figure 3.8).",
,The  same principle  applies to  the general  government  sector  (govern-,
,"ment  enterprises  are  treated  as  part  of  other  sectors,  according  to  the",
,"activity in which they engage). As a royalties-receiving sector, its revenues",
,(taxes and fees) derive from the already counted flows in the primary sec-,
,"tor, and thus cannot be counted again in the measure of the total product",
,(although  these  revenues  may  add  powerfully  to  total  transactions).  In,
,"IO tables,  this  means  excluding  the government  industry  dummy  sector",
,"from the revenue side, as well as the corresponding row entry in the  final-",
demand government column on the use side (Figure 3.10).,,
,The next step is to extend the analysis to the case of an open economy.,
,Since our purpose is to measure domestically produced value and surplus,
,"value, the GDP concept (which measures output produced within the na-",
,tion) is preferable to the GNP concept (which measures output produced,
,by  U.S.  persons  or  corporations  anywhere  in  the  world).  We  therefore,
,exclude the rest-of-world  industry column and row from our coverage of,
,"production  and trade, because this is merely the balancing item between",
,"the GDP and the GNP concepts.  In addition,  since foreign trade induces",
,"transfers  of  value,  the  value  realized  within  the  primary  sectors  reflects",
,not only the value produced within the country but also any (negative or,
,positive)  international  transfers  of  value.  We  would  therefore  have  to,
,adjust  for these transfers  in order to recover the magnitude of  produced,
,value.  This  could  be  done  by  adding  the  net  international  transfer  of,
,"value T to realized surplus value on the revenue side, and to the realized",
,"trade  balance  X â€” IM  on  the  use  side,  once  the  basic  Marxian  totals",
have been derived.,,
,"Finally, input-output tables list a dummy industry called the household",
,industry; it is designed to represent the output of the domestic services of,
,"maids,  chauffeurs,  and  baby-sitters.  The  money  value  of  this  output  is",
,"taken to be equal to wages alone, since the activities in question are non-",
,capitalist. The only entries associated with this dummy industry appear in,
,the value-added  row of  the household  column and in the household row,
,"of the consumption column, both equal to the wages of domestic workers.",
,"We exclude this sector from our coverage of total value and product,  on",
,the grounds that paid domestic labor is largely noncapitalist  activity.,
,Adjusting conventional  IO tables in the ways just indicated (except for,
,"the transfer of  value T), we can map out the overall relation between IO",
,accounts  and  Marxian categories  as depicted  in Figure  3.11. A  dash in a,
,cell  indicates  that  it is empty  by construction  (as in the case of  most  of,
