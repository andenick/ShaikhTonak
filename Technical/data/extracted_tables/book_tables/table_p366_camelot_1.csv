"1  Aglietta defines  m, as the current-dollar value added per hour of  labor, which in"
"our notation can be written as mt =  (Y/L)t =  [(py-Yr)/(Ay-Yr)]t = (py/Ay)t, since"
"the money  value  of  net  output  is its price index  multiplied  by its  real level,  and"
the labor value of  net output  (which  is equal to the total amount  of  living labor
time L) is its unit value index multiplied by its real level. He also defines mt as the
"ratio of  the money  wage bill to the value of  labor power,  which we can write as"
"mt =  (W/V)t =  [(pc-CRw)/(Ac-CRw)]t =  (pc/Ac)t,  where  CRw  is  the  total  real"
consumption  of  workers  (this assumes  workers consume  their wages).  Then the
"ratio mt/m t  = (pc/Ac),/(py/Ay)t = the ratio of  the price-value deviations of con-"
"sumer goods  and net product,  respectively,  at time t.  Aglietta  (1979, p.  89) calls"
"the index  number  (m,/mt)/(m 0/m 0)  ""the index  of  the  share  of  wages  at a con-"

relation between the variable capital share v' m V/( V + S) and the real wage share
