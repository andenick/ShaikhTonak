are genuine  uses  of  the existing total  product.  By excluding  the dummy,
"government  industry,  we  simply  exclude  any  expansion  of  the  measure",
of  this product.,
,Because business payments to government  (net interest paid and taxes
"net of  subsidies) are recorded in value added, their introduction changes",
the distribution but not the magnitude of business value added. But since,
the subsequent payment of government wages out of these same revenues,
"is recorded as the creation of a government net product, the conventional",
aggregate measures of gross and net product are expanded by WG.,
,Business payments to government  leave the measure of  business value
"added unchanged,  so they also leave the measure of  business  profit-type",
income  unchanged  (where  profit-type  income  is  defined  as  value  added,
plus royalties  paid minus wages). There being no profit-type  income  for,
"government, it follows that aggregate profit-type income is unchanged by",
"the inclusion  of  general government.  On the other hand, since net inter-",
est paid  and indirect business taxes reduce the portion of  business value,
"added  which goes  to  profit,  and since profit  taxes reduce the portion  of",
"profit  which firms get  to  keep,  the  inclusion  of  general  government  re-",
duces the aggregate measures of  pre- and post-tax  profit.,
,"Finally, to the extent that the government transfers some of its revenues"
"back  to  the royalties  sector  as (say)  ground rent or finance charges, this",
"would expand the revenues of the royalties sector. Measured gross output,",
"value added, and even profits of the royalties sector would rise, and with",
"this so too would the corresponding aggregate measures (since, as we have",
"already  seen,  the  payment  of  taxes  etc.  does  not  reduce  the  measured",
gross or net output of  the business sector). This result is the same as the,
"one derived earlier from household payments to the royalties sector, and",
includes  the  possibility  that  measured  profit-type  income  could  exceed,
surplus value.,
,"In summary,  royalty  payments  by primary sectors to  the  government"
already  show  up  in the  value  added  of  the  originating  sectors  and can-,
not therefore  be counted  again if they happen to be transferred  to some,
other  sector  or  group.  But  orthodox  accounts  do  count  (a  portion  of),
,"such transfers,  precisely because they view them as measures of  the gov-"
ernment's  output; thus they inflate  the measures of  total value and total,
,"product by the sum of these transfers.  Specifically,  they count any wages"
paid by government to its nonproduction employees as a measure of addi-,
tional  government  product  (recorded  through  the creation  of  a dummy,
,"government  industry),  and  count  any  transfer  from  the  government  to"
,the royalties sector as a measure of the additional product created by the
royalties  sector.  By  restricting  ourselves  to  the  sum  of  the gross  output,
