## Part I: Nick's Project Values & Standards

### **1. Accuracy & Quality Standards**

**"Perfect Replication" Philosophy**
- Nick's projects aim for the highest possible accuracy (achieved 93.8% exact match in S&T replication)
- "Perfect" means methodologically sound, not just close approximations
- Systematic validation and cross-checking is expected at every stage
- Quality metrics should be quantified and reported precisely

**Evidence from Interactions**:
- "The goal of this project is the perfect replication of the methodology"
- Appreciated systematic troubleshooting: "Can you troubleshoot and think about why the data is not exactly the same?"
- Valued precision: Celebrated achieving 30/32 exact matches (93.8% accuracy)

**Implementation for Agents**:
- Always quantify quality metrics (MAE, exact matches, correlation coefficients)
- Build validation layers into every analysis
- Document precision limits and measurement boundaries
- Never settle for "good enough" - always push for highest achievable accuracy

---

### **2. Methodological Transparency**

**"Zero Undocumented Divergences" Principle**
- Every methodological choice must be explicitly documented
- All deviations from original approaches require clear rationale
- Transparency enables expert review and modification
- Assumptions should be testable and modifiable

**Evidence from Interactions**:
- "It is crucial that I know every single divergence you take from the Shaikh and Tonak method"
- Emphasized documentation: "write a detailed documentation of these results with your evaluation"
- Wanted systematic error analysis: "verify these weren't systematic errors masquerading as rounding differences"

**Implementation for Agents**:
- Document every methodological choice with explicit rationale
- Create "divergence logs" for any changes from baseline approaches
- Make all assumptions explicit and modifiable
- Build audit trails for all calculations and transformations

---

### **3. Expert Empowerment & Research Accessibility**

**"Researcher Control" Philosophy**
- Experts should be able to modify any discretionary choices
- Provide spreadsheet interfaces for non-technical researcher input
- Systems should be modular and modifiable
- Enable independent validation and replication

**Evidence from Interactions**:
- "I want you to do it yourself, but allow for an easy spreadsheet that researchers can open and change"
- "I want for you to attempt to do this yourself, but also have that correspondence that is updated to the present date ready for any researcher who wishes to change the correspondences"
- Valued expert input capability throughout extension planning

**Implementation for Agents**:
- Always create expert-editable interfaces (Excel spreadsheets preferred)
- Make systems modular so components can be modified independently
- Provide clear instructions for researcher modification
- Build sensitivity analysis tools for testing alternative assumptions

---

### **4. Reality-Based vs Theoretical Approaches**

**"Data First" Methodology**
- Examine actual available data before creating theoretical frameworks
- Base analysis on real data structures, not assumed categories
- Validate theoretical models against empirical evidence
- Correct course when reality differs from assumptions

**Evidence from Interactions**:
- Nick immediately identified: "And this correspondence framework has already identified the differing industry classifications in the input output tables after 1990?"
- Caught fundamental error: Creating theoretical NAICS mappings without examining actual available data
- Appreciated the correction and wanted it documented

**Implementation for Agents**:
- Always examine actual data before creating analytical frameworks
- Base categorizations on real available data, not theoretical possibilities
- When caught in assumption-based errors, document the correction thoroughly
- Build data discovery phases into project workflows

---

## Part II: Nick's Communication Style & Preferences

### **5. Communication Patterns**

**Direct & Substantive Feedback Style**

**Evidence from Interactions**:
- Requested: "detailed documentation of these results with your evaluation"
- Asked for: "state of the project report" with specific organizational recommendations
- Appreciated systematic validation: "systematic error audit" approach

### **6. Error Handling & Learning Philosophy**

**"Correction as Improvement" Approach**
- Nick quickly identifies fundamental flaws but appreciates when they're corrected
- Errors become learning opportunities and documentation improvements
- Values agents who can recognize and fix their own mistakes
- Wants corrections documented for future reference

**Pattern from S&T Project**:
1. **Initial Error**: Created theoretical correspondence framework
2. **Nick's Feedback**: "figured out exactly what input is actually necessary from an expert?"
3. **Correction Response**: Built data discovery system, documented the error
4. **Nick's Appreciation**: Acknowledged the correction and asked for it to be noted

**Implementation for Agents**:
- When Nick identifies errors, immediately pivot to correction mode
- Document the error, the correction, and lessons learned
- Build the learning into future project frameworks
- Treat corrections as valuable feedback, not failures
