# Daily Progress — 2025-09-21

## Summary
- Established an authentic, methodology-faithful baseline for Table 5.4.
- Preserved all book values and added only algebraic identity-based series.
- Verified alignment of r' with SP/(K×u) and documented identities extensively.

## Artifacts Created/Updated
- Final authentic table: `src/analysis/replication/output/table_5_4_authentic.csv`
- Authentic formulas reference: `src/analysis/replication/output/AUTHENTIC_FORMULAS_REFERENCE.md`
- Authentic replication summary: `src/analysis/replication/output/AUTHENTIC_REPLICATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Integrity reports: `src/analysis/replication/output/AUTHENTICITY_CHECK.md`, `authenticity_check.json`
- Methodology doc updates: `AUTHENTIC_REPLICATION_METHODOLOGY.md` (formulas injected)
- Status report updated: `REPLICATION_STATUS_REPORT.md`
- Data dictionary: `docs/TABLE_5_4_DATA_DICTIONARY.md`
- Runner and tasks: pipeline runner and workspace tasks to streamline execution

## Key Results
- Integrity: PASS (Columns checked: 18; mismatches: 0)
- r' vs SP/(K×u): MAE = 0.002219; max |err| = 0.007456; n = 31
- s'u identities across parts align at rounding-level differences
- No interpolation used; genuine gaps preserved as NaN

## Notes and Rationale
- Kept book `r'` intact; exported derived profit rate as `r_prime_calc` to maintain authenticity while exposing the identity for validation.
- Unified capital name `K_unified` purely harmonizes `KK` and `K`; it does not fabricate values.
- Provided both SP- and S-based derivations for (V, C) for transparency.

## Next Steps
- Extract and implement exact S&T definitions for $r'$, $s'$, $c'$, $K$, $SP$, and $gK$ from the book text.
- Cross-check Pn coverage for 1974–1989 and incorporate only if present in the original source or text.
- Consider minimal tests asserting identity MAE thresholds for CI-level guardrails.

## Conclusion
We end the day with an authentic final export, validated formulas, and integrity safeguards in place. The path to methodology-exact replication is clear: incorporate the book’s explicit variable definitions and recompute the few remaining ambiguous series accordingly.
