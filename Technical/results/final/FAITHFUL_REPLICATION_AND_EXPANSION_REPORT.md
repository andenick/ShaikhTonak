# Faithful Replication and Expansion — Final Report

Date: 2025-09-22 19:58:17

## Executive summary

- Historical replication (1958–1989): Exactly preserves the book's r' series.
- Expansion (1990–2023): Computed strictly by r = SP/(K×u), with SP and K staged from BEA and u normalized to a 0–1 fraction.
- Levels: Historical mean r' ≈ 0.405; Modern mean r ≈ 0.124 (range 0.109–0.155).
- No proxies, interpolation, or arbitrary scaling applied. Only a units normalization on u (percent → fraction) consistent with S&T's usage.

## Methodological fidelity

- Historical period uses published r' exactly, including the known missing 1974 value (left blank).
- Modern period honors the identity: r = SP / (K × u).
- SP and K are derived from official sources aligned with S&T definitions:
  - SP: Business NDP − Compensation (Private Industries + Government Enterprises), from NIPA flat files.
  - K: Current-cost net stock of private fixed assets, from BEA Fixed Assets.
- Capacity utilization: Federal Reserve G.17, converted to fraction.

## Units audit

- modern_SP_st_consistent: (unit not documented)
- modern_K_st_consistent: (unit not documented)
- capacity_utilization: (unit not documented)

- By construction, r is unitless.

## Results in historical context

The postwar pattern (1958–1989) presents a plateau in profitability, followed by a downturn in the
1970s and a partial recovery in the 1980s. The expansion era (1990–2023) continues with a lower mean rate of
profit. Peaks coincide with high utilization phases (late 1990s, mid-2000s, post-2010s), while troughs mark weak
demand and crises such as 2008–2009. The enduring gap relative to mid-century levels is consistent with a
higher organic composition of capital and heightened competitive pressures, limiting the durability of recoveries
in r, even amidst productivity improvements.

## Next steps

- Bridge-year diagnostic (documentation only): compare 1989 published r' with implied r using historical u and staged K/SP to document residual
  definition differences (no scaling applied).
- Add a parallel, clearly labeled diagnostic series that uses corporate profits or KLEMS for sensitivity (kept separate from faithful results).
- Extend SP and K to the latest available year; add versioned metadata snapshots for reproducibility.
- Package the pipeline as a reusable CLI with pinned environment for long-term reproducibility.
