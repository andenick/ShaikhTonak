# KLEMS Analysis (Separate)

This area is for independent analysis using BEA-BLS KLEMS data (1997–2023).

Principle: Do not integrate KLEMS into the main S&T time series unless units and concepts are harmonized without arbitrary scaling. Use this area for:

- Industry-level analysis
- Exploratory trends in VA, LC, and surplus = VA − LC
- Development of a principled monetary K series compatible with SP

To run the current KLEMS analysis runner:

- `run_klems_analysis.py` executes a safe, separate analysis without modifying the primary S&T update outputs.
