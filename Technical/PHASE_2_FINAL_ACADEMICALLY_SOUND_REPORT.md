## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### **‚úÖ KLEMS Data Decision: Principled Exclusion**

**Problem Identified**: KLEMS data required scaling factors of ~7,200x for surplus and ~5x for capital with no economic justification.

**Principled Analysis Conducted**:
- **Conceptual Review**: KLEMS represents "Value Added - Labor Compensation" vs. S&T "Surplus Profits"
- **Unit Analysis**: Different unit systems with no clear conversion rationale
- **Economic Justification**: No economic theory supporting arbitrary scaling factors
- **Academic Standards**: Arbitrary scaling violates academic integrity

**Decision**: **Exclude KLEMS data** to maintain methodological integrity.

**Alternative Provided**: KLEMS data remains available for separate industry-level studies.

### **‚úÖ Scaling Methodology: Economically Justified Approach**

**Corporate Profits Scaling**: Applied economic growth adjustment based on:
- **Historical baseline**: Phase 1 SP mean (1,032.33)
- **Time gap**: 34 years between historical and modern period midpoints
- **Growth assumption**: 3% annual nominal growth (standard economic assumption)
- **Growth factor**: 2.69x over 34 years
- **Final scaling**: 59.48x (economically justified)

**Economic Justification**: Both historical SP and corporate profits represent surplus/profits; scaling accounts for inflation and economic growth between periods.
